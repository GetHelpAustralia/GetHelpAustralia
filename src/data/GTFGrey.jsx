      <p>
        Many people who have engaged in online sexual behaviour involving
        children believe that there is a ‘grey area’, between what is legal and
        illegal. Test change.
      </p>
      <p>There is no grey area.</p>

      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Non-sexual images of children</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are viewing any image of a child for sexual gratification,
        regardless of whether the child is nude, semi-nude or clothed, then this
        is not appropriate. The police may investigate the possession of
        multiple images of clothed children.
      </p>

      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Nude images of children on naturist websites</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are viewing any image of a child for sexual gratification, then
        this is not appropriate. If the naturist images are showing nude
        children in a sexualised manner, then this is illegal.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Uncertainty about a child’s age</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are unsure whether it’s an adult or child in an image or video,
        or that you’re communicating with, do not continue.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no ‘grey area’ here. If there is any doubt, stop. The law is
        clear.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>The legal age of consent is 16</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Whilst this is true and you can legally have a sexual relationship with
        a 16 year old, the legal age for a person to be in a sexual image is 18.
        This includes viewing sexual images, or requesting images or webcam
        activity during an online communication.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of your opinion about this and regardless of whether you
        understood this to be the case in the past, you now know, so stick to
        the law.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>The images are legal in their country of origin</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Different countries have different laws around what age a person has to
        be to be shown in a sexual image or engage in sexual behaviour. However,
        it is still illegal to engage in this online sexual behaviour in the UK.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Sexual drawings/Manga</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Sexual drawings of children are also illegal in the UK. Manga is a style
        of drawing for comic books and novels, which originates from Japan.
        There are many Manga drawings depicting children in sexual situations.
        These are illegal to view in the UK.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>I’m not a UK citizen</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Any online sexual behaviour involving children from within the UK, is
        illegal, regardless of where you are from.

        justifications that people use to allow themselves to continue offending
        online.
