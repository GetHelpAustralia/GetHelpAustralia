        Your illegal internet use is only one part of you, it does not define
        you:

        You need to take one step at a time, do not rush through it. Our role is
        to ask the right questions not give you the answers; you need to engage
        in the work and reflect on your life. It has taken a long time to get
        where you are and change can take time too. Don’t be hard on yourself if
        it doesn’t happen overnight.

        Quite often people who offend online that that behaviour affects their
        self-esteem and stops them being the person they want to be. Spend some
        time thinking about some positive goals that will help you move towards
        being the person you want to be. It is important to set goals in
        manageable bitesize ways that makes them much more achievable and makes
        change even more likely.
