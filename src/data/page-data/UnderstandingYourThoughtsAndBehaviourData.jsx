        Having sexual thoughts about children doesn’t always lead to sexual
        behaviour. You have the power to choose how you behave and this guide
        gives you information and tools to manage your thoughts, feelings and
        actions effectively. By recognising and valuing your positive qualities
        and behaviour, you’ll be motivated and encouraged to reduce your risk of
        offending.

        This section is based on our experience of working with people who have
        experienced sexual thoughts about children, incorporating their feedback
        and suggestions.

        You can work through these in order, but there may be ones that feel
        more important to you that you want to address first. We encourage you
        to explore all the sections, even if you feel confident in some areas,
        as you may still find them helpful.
