        If you are under investigation for online sexual offences against
        children, we can help you change your behaviour.
      </p>
      <h4 className="secondary-color">You can talk to us</h4>
      <p>
        We are a leading UK charity that offers support and guidance to anyone
        concerned about their own or someone else’s sexual thoughts or behaviour
        towards children. We help thousands of people each year who are in your
        situation and we can offer you non-judgemental advice and help to stop
        offending.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our anonymous <b>Stop It Now! helpline, live chat and secure email</b>{" "}
        are available to anyone, including people under investigation for, or
        convicted of, viewing sexual images of children or having sexual
        conversations with children online (grooming).
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not have to give any identifying information like your family
        name, address or telephone number. If you’re not ready to speak to
        someone just yet you can use our confidential live chat or send us a
        secure email.
      </p>
      <p>
        The experienced advisors on our helpline have a range of backgrounds
        including social and health care, counselling and psychology. They can
        give you confidential support and won’t judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also help your partner, friends or family members. We won’t share
        with them anything you have told us, and they don’t have to know you’ve
        called. We will give them information, support and a safe space for them
        to talk about their thoughts, worries and concerns.

        “I am glad that I called the Stop It Now! helpline – it was such a
        relief to be able to talk openly about what was happening, and to have a
        friendly voice on the end of the phone.”
      </p>
      <h4 className="secondary-color">Taking care of yourself</h4>
      <p>
        You may have negative thoughts, feel depressed or hopeless during or
        after the investigation. Sometimes you may experience feelings of panic
        or even think about harming yourself or committing suicide. These
        feelings are quite common but you shouldn’t try to deal with them alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very important that you find help and support to manage them.
        Reach out to friends and family, if you can. Our Stop It Now! helpline
        can offer you support through these challenging times and our website
        has self-help information.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also get mental health support from your GP and from
        organisations like the Samaritans who help by talking to people in times
        of crisis. The NHS has tips on looking after yourself and links to
        accessing support.

        your online behaviour. It can be difficult to talk about but our
        helpline, live chat and secure messaging service offers a confidential
        and non-judgemental space to talk through and address it. Changing for
        the better and living an offending-free life starts with understanding

      <h4 className="secondary-color">Your friends and family</h4>
      <p>
        You might be worried about the impact of your behaviour and arrest on
        people close to you including partners and family members. This will be
        a shock for them but it does not mean that they will reject you or that
        your family will fall apart. But they will also need help and support
        and so please pass our on information to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children’s services might become involved if you have regular contact
        with children, including your own. The police will share information
        about the investigation so that a risk assessment can be completed. This
        may mean restrictions will be placed on any contact, especially during
        the investigation.
