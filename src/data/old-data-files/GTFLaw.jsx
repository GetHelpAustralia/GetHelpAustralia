      <p>
        In Australia there are several offences regarding sexual images of
        children and online sexual conversations with children.
      </p>
      <h4 className="secondary-color">Sexual images of children</h4>
      <p>
        According to UK law (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland),
        there are four main offences relating to the access of sexual images of
        children, that you can be penalised for.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Possession</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Having, in your possession, a sexual image of anyone under the age of
        18, whether this is a physical or electronic copy.
      </p>
      Distribution
      <p>
        Sending a sexual image of a child to another person. It includes
        distribution through chat rooms, email, phone applications, text
        messaging, USB sticks and file sharing websites (peer-to-peer).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes file sharing websites will allow others to access your files
        without your direct knowledge. You need to check your settings to ensure
        this isn’t the case. The authorities will assume that you have consented
        to any form of distribution and will not accept any lack of
        understanding. If the authorities find evidence of intent to distribute,
        even if you haven’t done so, it is possible to be charged for
        distribution.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Making</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Making an electronic copy of a sexual image of a child. This includes
        copies of images that are purposefully saved by a user on to a device
        and the automatic copy saved to a device when an image is clicked on. It
        also includes images automatically downloaded from file sharing
        websites.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Taking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Taking your own sexual images of a child.</p>
      <h4 className="secondary-color">Sexual communication with a child</h4>
      <p>
        Section 15a of the Sexual Offences Act (2003) makes it illegal for an
        adult to intentionally communicate with a child under 16 for a sexual
        purpose. This offence is sometimes referred to as ‘online grooming’. The
        offence is still committed whether or not the child communicates with
        the adult.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the adult doesn’t reasonably believe the person is 16 or over (for
        example the person states they are under 16) then this is a criminal
        offence.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone you are communicating with online states that they are under
        16, you are committing an offence, even if you do not believe they
        really are under 16.
      </p>
      <h4 className="secondary-color">
        Other online sexual offences relating to children
      </h4>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Exposing a child to sexual material</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Intentionally showing a child sexual material, including adult
        pornography, sexual images of children and self-generated sexual images
        (e.g. showing your genitals to a child over webcam), through an
        electronic device or internet application.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Inciting a child to engage in sexual activity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Encouraging a child to perform a sexual act or to show sexual parts of
        their body, for example over live webcam or asking a child to send a
        sexual image of themselves. This is a criminal offence if the child is
        under 18.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Meeting or arranging to meet a child for sexual purposes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most commonly, this is a secondary part to grooming a child online;
        after the trust has been built, arrangements to meet may be made.
        Alternatively, this could involve talking to other adults online and
        arranging to meet a particular child through them, for sexual purposes
        (in this case, money may be exchanged).
      </p>
      <h4 className="secondary-color">Other online sexual offences</h4>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Voyeurism</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Direct observation of another adult or child without their knowledge,
        when a reasonable level of privacy is expected. This includes, but is
        not limited to, cameras being set up in communal areas such as toilets,
        and private areas such as bedrooms, in order to record someone engaging
        in a private act (e.g. taking their clothes off or engaging in sexual
        activity). It also includes viewing live footage of another individual
        engaging in voyeuristic activities.
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Extreme pornography</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Possessing pornographic images that depict acts which threaten a
        person’s life or result in serious injury to a person’s anus, breasts or
        genitals. In addition, it includes bestiality (images depicting sexual
        activity between people and animals) and necrophilia (sexual intercourse
        with corpses).
      </p>
      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>Sexual chat about children</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Engaging in sexual chat about children with other internet users. This

      </ul>
      <p>
        Publishing any content which will have a negative effect on someone
        else, whether that is the reader or the subject of the content. Whilst
        writing or reading a sexual story about a child is not illegal, it is
        against the law to distribute and publish such material for this reason.
