        We’ve covered <b>what is illegal in the UK</b> regarding online sexual
        offences involving children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people who commit internet offences believe that they will never be
        caught – but this is not true. Police forces all over the country are
        running operations to specifically catch people who offend online, and
        it could be you next.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people who offend online think that their only consequence will be
        involvement with the police and the worst case scenario is going to
        prison. But there are many more consequences, and conviction affects
        your access to your children, your relationship, your finances and your
        job.

        You can find out about the consequences by watching this short film.

        As you can see, there are a lot of potential consequences to accessing
        sexual images of children. Not all of these happen to everyone and some
        people will experience different consequences to the ones mentioned, but
        these are the most common and the most likely.
