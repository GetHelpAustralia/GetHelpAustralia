      <p>These pages aim to tell you more information for the UK about:</p>

      <ul className="content-list">
        <li>
          what the law says about online sexual behaviour involving children
        </li>
        <li>
          the criminal justice system, from arrest to possible imprisonment
        </li>
        <li>potential consequences of offending to you and your family</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You need to ensure that you understand the law, so that you know what is
        right and wrong (even if you believe otherwise) and that you understand
        that being caught by the police will come with many consequences, not
        just the possibility of going to prison.
