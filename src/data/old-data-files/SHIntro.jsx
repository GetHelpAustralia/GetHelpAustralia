        Changing your own risky or illegal online behaviour isn’t always easy,
        but there’s lots that you can do to help yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our self-help pages will help you address the issues you might be
        experiencing. You can work through these in order, but there may be ones
        that feel more important to you and you want to start addressing first.

      <p>
        We encourage you to look at all sections as you may still find them
        helpful even if you don’t think they’re relevant.
