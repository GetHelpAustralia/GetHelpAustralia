        <p>
          The Good Lives Model tells us that everyone needs to feel satisfied in
          a few different areas of their life to feel good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, if we don’t find good, healthy ways to feel satisfied, we
          might use unhelpful or harmful ways instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          These might help us feel better in the moment but, over time, these
          strategies can hurt other people and ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The model breaks down the states of mind, personal characteristics,
          activities or experiences that are sought by people and, if achieved,
          they are likely to increase well-being.

        <h5 className="secondary-color">Creativity</h5>
        <p>
          It is important that we have activities in our lives that we feel good
          at. In order to feel good about ourselves, we need to have a sense of
          achievement. This can also help with our self-esteem. This doesn’t
          mean actually being ‘the best’ in comparison to others, but feeling
          that we are doing the best we can in whatever we do.
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Excellence in work</h5>
        <p>
          This can also involve feeling like we have mastered activities and
          skills-training that are important to us in the workplace. It can
          include creativity, like being able to create or make new things, come
          up with new ideas, or be artistic or practical in some way.
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Excellence in play</h5>
        <p>
          This is about how people spend their time and the range of activities
          in which they are involved. It is important for people to see that all
          activities are worthwhile and for people to have activities which
          offer elements of fun, excitement, challenge and achievement. This
          might involve hobbies, work, and exercise. This is also about
          achieving a balance of activities, for example, work/life balance.
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Spirituality</h5>
        <p>
          Whoever we are, it’s important for us to feel like we understand our
          purpose in life. This could stem from religion but it doesn’t have to.
          This could be something like ‘being a good friend’, ‘being a good
          brother/sister’ or contributing to your community in some way.
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Inner peace</h5>
        <p>
          This is about feeling peaceful and comfortable. It means that we
          should feel free from difficult feelings, and that we should know how
          to deal with these feelings if we have them. This also means feeling
          safe; physically and emotionally.
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Life</h5>
        <p>
          This is about how we live our lives in terms of our physical health
          (exercise, diet, feeling comfortable with our appearance) and
          emotional health (looking after ourselves inside).
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Relatedness</h5>
        <p>
          This is about having intimate, romantic and familial relationships.
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Excellence in agency</h5>
        <p>
          This is about feeling like we can manage and control our lives. The
          ability to make decisions and feel as though we have a say in our
          lives is very important. This is also about being able to manage the
          way we behave and the way we feel, for example, knowing what to do if
          we have had a bad day. This is also about being able to make decisions
          and solve everyday problems in life.
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Knowledge</h5>
        <p>
          This is about having knowledge and understanding so we feel informed
          about our world, so that we feel we understand what is going on around
          us. Knowledge can come from life experience, what we learn at school,
          from books or from the media. It does not mean ‘being clever’, but
          feeling as though we know what we need to in order to feel alright in
          the world.
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Community</h5>
        <p>
          This is about having a sense of belonging and responsibility to the
          social group we live in. This also includes a sense of fitting in. It
          is important that we have a group of people where we feel we fit.
          Belonging might stem from friends, family, colleagues, a religious
          group or another group of people.
        </p>
        <h5 className="secondary-color">Pleasure</h5>
        <p>
          Feeling good in the here and now. This is the ability to anchor
          ourselves in the moment and have gratitude for what we have, rather
          than worrying about the past or the future.
        </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes it can be really hard to meet your needs and there can be
            things that get in the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might then try to meet your needs through unhelpful ways,
            particularly if these are things that you have done before, because
            we often go back to old habits, particularly in times of stress.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s an example</p>
          <p>
            Tony has previously been convicted of internet offences. Tony lives
            alone and is quite isolated. However, he places great emphasis on
            social contact/activity which he used to meet through online chat.
            Tony has decided to meet this need by volunteering to undertake work
            in a community garden where he would meet a lot of new people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing with the example of Tony – he may face barriers to
            meeting his need for connection as his restrictions, due to previous
            convictions, mean he can’t volunteer in the garden because a lot of
            young people spend time there. Tony has the potential to relapse
            into inappropriate use of the Internet in order to meet other people
            again. However, Tony was aware this might be a problem and had
            planned ahead so he had a backup plan. He thought that if he was
            unable to do voluntary work in the garden he would be able to work
            for the local animal shelter. Tony was able to start walking dogs
            for the charity and met other volunteers so still got a chance to
            meet his need for socialising, plus he started doing more exercise
            so felt healthier.

          <h4 className="secondary-color">How do I plan for obstacles?</h4>
          <p>
            Some obstacles are easier to overcome than others. To overcome them
            you might need to get help or support from professionals or
            specialist organisations (such as counselling to deal with grief or
            other negative life experiences).
          </p>
          <p>
            Some obstacles can take a long time and will be hard work to
            overcome, for example, building self-confidence. But obstacles can
            be beaten and it is important to keep positive when tackling
            obstacles.
