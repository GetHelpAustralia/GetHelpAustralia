          The Good Lives Model tells us that everyone needs to feel satisfied in
          a few different areas of their life to feel good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, if we don’t find good, healthy ways to feel satisfied, we
          might use unhelpful or harmful ways instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          These might help us feel better in the moment but, over time, these
          strategies can hurt other people and ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The model breaks down the states of mind, personal characteristics,
          activities or experiences that are sought by people and, if achieved,
          they are likely to increase well-being.

          <p>
            Sometimes it can be really hard to meet your needs and there can be
            things that get in the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            You might then try to meet your needs through unhelpful ways,
            particularly if these are things that you have done before, because
            we often go back to old habits, particularly in times of stress.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s an example</p>
          <p>
            Tony has previously been convicted of internet offences. Tony lives
            alone and is quite isolated. However, he places great emphasis on
            social contact/activity which he used to meet through online chat.
            Tony has decided to meet this need by volunteering to undertake work
            in a community garden where he would meet a lot of new people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuing with the example of Tony – he may face barriers to
            meeting his need for connection as his restrictions, due to previous
            convictions, mean he can’t volunteer in the garden because a lot of
            young people spend time there. Tony has the potential to relapse
            into inappropriate use of the Internet in order to meet other people
            again. However, Tony was aware this might be a problem and had
            planned ahead so he had a backup plan. He thought that if he was
            unable to do voluntary work in the garden he would be able to work
            for the local animal shelter. Tony was able to start walking dogs
            for the charity and met other volunteers so still got a chance to
            meet his need for socialising, plus he started doing more exercise
            so felt healthier.

          <h4 className="secondary-color">How do I plan for obstacles?</h4>
          <p>
            Some obstacles are easier to overcome than others. To overcome them
            you might need to get help or support from professionals or
            specialist organisations (such as counselling to deal with grief or
            other negative life experiences).
          </p>
          <p>
            Some obstacles can take a long time and will be hard work to
            overcome, for example, building self-confidence. But obstacles can
            be beaten and it is important to keep positive when tackling
            obstacles. See our{" "}
