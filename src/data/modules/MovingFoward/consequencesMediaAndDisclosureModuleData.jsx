        <p>
          Being conviction of a sexual offence has lots of significant
          consequences. One of the main outcomes is being involved with the
          police and the criminal justice system.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the police become involved, they will investigate the offence.
          Based on the evidence they will proceed in one of three ways.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">No further action</h4>
        <p>
          If the police do not find substantial evidence or believe that there
          is insufficient proof to press charges, no further legal action will
          be taken.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Formal police</h4>
        <p>
          At the decision of both the police and the Crown Prosecution Service,
          a formal caution may be offered. This caution can be provided and
          accepted at a police station without the need for a court hearing.
          Although not establishing a criminal conviction, a caution will be
          recorded on an individual’s criminal record and will be visible in
          standard and enhanced disclosure checks. Furthermore, accepting a
          caution for a sexual offence entails inclusion in the sex offenders
          register for a period of two years.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Charged</h4>
        <p>
          In cases where you are charged with offences, a court date will be
          assigned for your appearance. This initial hearing typically takes
          place in a Magistrates Court, but depending on the nature of the
          offences, your case might be transferred to a Crown Court.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the court appearance, you will have the opportunity to enter a
          plea of guilty or not guilty. If you plead not guilty, a trial date
          will be set. If you enter a guilty plea, a sentencing date will be
          scheduled. The court might also request a pre-sentence report from the
          National Probation Service to help determine an appropriate sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The various sentencing options are detailed below. However, predicting
          the specific outcome of sentencing can be challenging, and is
          therefore important to get a lawyer in all cases.

        <h4 className="secondary-color">Sentencing options</h4>
        <p>
          If you are convicted, there are, several sentencing options are
          available.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Community sentence</h4>
        <p>
          This involves serving the sentence within the community under the
          supervision of the Probation Service. It often comes with a
          requirement to engage in rehabilitation, which could encompass
          offense-related work or community service activities. Community orders
          typically span at least two years to allow completion of all order
          requirements, but this period can extend to up to three years.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Suspended sentence</h4>
        <p>
          A suspended sentence is a custodial sentence wherein the individual is
          not required to go to prison as long as they refrain from committing
          further offenses and comply with imposed requirements. Failure to
          comply or committing additional offenses can lead to the activation of
          the suspended sentence, requiring the individual to serve the
          suspended period in custody. Similar to a community order, a suspended
          sentence can include specific conditions, such as offense-related
          work.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Custodial sentence</h4>
        <p>
          Upon receiving a custodial sentence, the offender will be taken
          directly from the court to the designated prison where the sentence
          will be served.

          with another criminal offence.

          A sexual harm prevention order (SHPO) is a court order put in place to
          prevent a person from engaging in a particular activity. It is very
          common for a person who is convicted of online sexual offences
          relating to children, to be subject to a SHPO and is often given at
          the time of sentencing.

        <p>
          Children’s Services may become involved if you have interactions with
          children and the police tell them about an arrest. The level of
          involvement can change during an investigation, and sometimes
          restrictions may be re-evaluated, especially during the sentencing
          phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, a ‘Section 47 enquiry’ might be conducted to determine
          if further engagement with your family is necessary. This assessment
          helps decide the appropriate actions to safeguard and enhance the
          well-being of the relevant child or children.

        <h4 className="secondary-color">Insurance</h4>
        <p>
          Criminal convictions can affect your insurance policies. Individuals
          with such convictions statistically face a higher risk of becoming
          victims of crime, leading insurers to view them as higher-risk
          clients. For detailed information, please look at our resources and
          see the specific policies to determine whether disclosure is required.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Employment</h4>
        <p>
          During an investigation for a sexual offence, you may be at risk of
          losing your employment. It’s important to review your employment
          contract to understand whether you need to disclose a caution or
          conviction.

          When looking for a new job, certain roles may not be suitable for you,
          particularly those involving children or vulnerable adults. When
          applying for specific jobs, you’ll likely be asked to declare any

          Court reporters attend criminal courts and may choose to cover any
          case. These reporters are overseen by the Independent Press Standards
          Organisation, adhering to clear reporting guidelines. They are

            You might want to think about whether to tell close family or

            media.
          </li>
          <li>
            For people under investigation and their families, we recommend
            temporarily deactivating social media accounts or adjusting privacy
            settings during sentencing hearings to minimise exposure to media
            coverage.

          <li>
            If you are worried about potential targeting by people in the

            assess the possibility of implementing added security measures.

      <div className="tab-main-content">
        <p>
          It can be very difficult to talk about sex, particularly sexual
          offences. It’s hard to know how to approach these conversations and
          who to share with. This section aims to give you the communication
          skills and insight to help talking to other people about your
          offending.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Understanding reactions</h4>
        <p>
          Understanding how other people might feel can help you anticipate how
          they might reaction. Sexual thoughts or behaviours involving children
          are unexpected and naturally raise numerous questions. For instance,
          your partner might wonder about your motivations, the consequences for
          you, how it impacts them, the well-being of any children you have, and
          the implications for the future. Think about your own emotions of fear
          and distress. Other people are likely to share these emotions and will
          also be shocked by finding out about behaviour through you or the
          police.
        </p>
        <p>
          People’s reactions might not align with your predictions. Shock could
          stop people being able to think of questions, while others might have
          many questions or repeatedly ask the same thing. Tears, anger, and
          even self-blame are possible responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s important to tell people that you know you are accountable for
          your actions and try to listen to them and respect their needs, such
          as requiring space to process the situation.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Active listening</h4>
        <p>
          Communication involves both speaking and listening. To understand
          other peoples’ emotions, it’s important to ask questions and genuinely
          listen. This can be tough, especially if they express negativity or
          intense anger due to your behaviour.

          <li>
            Verbal responses: offering pertinent comments, sounds, and relevant
            questions displays active involvement.
          </li>
          <li>

          skills we’ve discussed. Your partner can be deeply affected by your
          actions, and they might have questions. It’s crucial to be honest

            Answer the “why” question: children will likely want to know why
            their parent did what they did. Explain that it’s complex and that
