          A relapse is anything you do that is illegal, but it might not only be
          that – a relapse might be anything you know is wrong or anything you
          think is dangerous for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, looking at adult pornography might be legal but you know
          for yourself it’s wrong – it just feels wrong or it brings you too
          close to the illegal stuff you used to do. Or allowing yourself to
          have a sexual fantasy about a child; it may not involve direct harm to
          the child but it could lead you to other behaviours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relapse prevention is about recognising that difficult times can
          happen so it is important to be prepared for them.

        <br></br>
        <p>
          Relapses often happen when you’re experiencing negative thoughts and
          feelings, for example, bored, anxious, depressed or lonely. And that
          can be risky – it’s probably been risky in the past – because:
        </p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>
            you might want to do something exciting which will distract you from
            those negative feelings or cover them up
          </li>
          <li>
            sometimes when you feel bad about yourself, you might even want to
            do something bad, almost as if to prove what a bad person you are
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But you understand yourself better than anyone else. Think back to
          what you learned in{" "}
          <Link
            className="secondary-color"
            to="/recognising-and-dealing-with-feelings"
          >
            <u>Recognising and dealing with feelings</u>
          </Link>{" "}
          or read it again if you need to. Just be aware of how things work for
          you and how they might have worked in the past when you’ve offended.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do give in to those bad feelings and end up doing something you
          know is wrong, you’ll feel worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are able to manage the feelings or situations without relapse
          then you’ll feel better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relapses are more likely if you’re still around people who encourage
          your negative behaviour. This might be people you have met online who
          encourage you to share images of children or talk sexually about them.
          Or it could be people you know who use sexual language about a child.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are people with their own problems and they are a problem to you
          if they’re encouraging you to do something wrong or illegal. It is
          important that you separate yourself from them; this is easier to do
          if they are online as you can block them. However, if they are work
          colleagues or family members this can be harder. In those situations,
          you can use some of the{" "}
          <Link className="secondary-color" to="/self-talk">
            <u>self-talk section</u>
          </Link>{" "}
          to help you manage this wonky thinking also known as cognitive
          distortions.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">How might a relapse happen?</h4>
        <p>
          A relapse usually happens in a number of stages, sometimes in quick
          succession. Just being aware of how this can work will give you
          greater control. And with self-control and determination, you can stop
          a relapse even at the very last stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look at the steps to relapse described below. Maybe you recognise them
          from the past. It’s very likely you might experience some or all of
          them in the future. Being prepared and understanding what’s going on
          and what could happen is your best defence against offending again.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Abstinence</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage, you’re not doing anything illegal or having
          inappropriate thoughts. If you’re lucky, this might come easily but,
          for some people or at some times, this might need quite a bit of
          self-control.&nbsp; But it’s OK – you’re coping and you know you’re
          doing the right thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Small decisions</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe your previous behaviour happened when you were going online late
          at night and the rest of your family was in bed. Maybe you can’t sleep
          and think you will watch some videos on YouTube to switch off. This
          might be taking you towards a risky situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Danger</h5>
        </p>
        <p>Now let’s look at the situation and your state of mind.</p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>
            Where are you? Perhaps you’re on your own with time on your hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            How are you feeling? Are you feeling down? You might be more tempted
            to do something wrong.
          </li>
          <li>
            What is your self-talk? Are you making it easy to cross barriers you
            have put in place?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Giving up</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          The danger by this stage is that you believe you’ve failed
          already.&nbsp; You tell yourself nothing’s changed – you’re as bad as
          ever, and you still have the same feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you feel that way, it’s really easy to think ‘I might as well
          just do it’.&nbsp; Remember though, you still have a choice and you
          can still choose to do the right thing – right for you and right for
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Lapse</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          You will know what a lapse involves for you – it is crossing
          boundaries that you put in place to keep yourself safe or starting
          illegal behaviours again.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re here, reading this, so it’s something you really don’t want to
          do and something you feel bad about. So, use those feelings and learn
          from what went wrong. Continue to develop a relapse prevention plan
          and reduce the risk of returning to old ways.

          Warning signs are the things that alert us and other people that
          something is wrong or that there this a potential danger or hazard.
          With regard to sexual offending, it includes physical, behavioural and
          emotional signs in children and adults.
        </p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>
            Physical warning signs could be noticing a person has stopped
            shaving and looking after themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Behavioural warning signs could be that a person is refusing to
            leave the house.
          </li>
          <li>
            Emotional warning signs could be that a person gets angry very
            quickly.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here is a list of warning signs that a person might recognise in
          themselves.
        </p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>
            Experiencing sexual thoughts about children that are difficult to
            manage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Experiencing thoughts that justify sexual behaviour with children.
          </li>
          <li>Isolating themselves.</li>
          <li>Making excuses to be around children.</li>
          <li>
            Seeking out the company of children; particularly spending time
            alone with children.
          </li>
          <li>Making excuses not to see family or friends.</li>
          <li>Experiencing the urge to go online and view sexual material.</li>
          <li>Masturbating to fantasies about children.</li>
          <li>Engaging in increased masturbation.</li>
          <li>Feeling anxious about their thoughts and feelings.</li>
          <li>
            Experiencing negative feelings for example, stress, loneliness,
            anxiety, depression, anger, hopelessness, among others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not allowing a child sufficient privacy or to make their own
            decisions on personal matters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insisting on physical affection such as kissing, hugging or
            wrestling even when the child clearly does not want it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spending most of their spare time with children and having little
            interest in spending time with people their own age.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treating a particular child as a favourite, making them feel
            ‘special’ compared with others in the family.
          </li>
          <li>Becoming fixated on a particular child.</li>
          <li>
            Feeling depressed, sad, lonely, angry, isolated or even suicidal.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This list doesn’t include every sign. The warning signs will be
          different for everyone so it is important that you consider what your
          personal warning signs are. There are likely to be other warning signs
          which are relevant for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Positive feelings also influence behaviour. It is not always obvious
          what people are feeling but there can be ‘clues’ based on body
          language and on what people say and do. It is important that you
          consider those ‘clues’ so that they can help you manage your thoughts
          and/or behaviour when needed.
