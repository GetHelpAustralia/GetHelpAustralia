          <h4 className="secondary-color">Management strategies</h4>
          <p>
            So you have identified which of your sexual thoughts or behaviours
            are inappropriate. We are now going to focus on strategies to manage
            them. For some people this will be easy, but for others it will take
            time, hard work, a lot of willpower and heaps of self-control. You
            are not alone if you feel it is too hard to control these thoughts,
            fantasies and behaviours but <strong>YOU ARE IN CONTROL</strong>
            &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>you can make a choice</strong>&nbsp;as to how
            much attention you choose to give to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next time you have an unhealthy sexual thought or urge, you can try
            to use one of these to help you stop. The more you use these, the
            more you will learn what works more effectively for you. It may be
            that you need to practice them or use a combination of these to find
            the best way for you.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Escape route</h5>
          <p>
            Sometimes we need to remove ourselves from the situation in which we
            are fantasising. Get up, get out of that room, leave the house if
            you have to. Go anywhere that stops you from having that sexual
            fantasy. Put yourself around people so that you can’t masturbate.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Active distraction</h5>

          <p>
            Do something that prevents you from thinking about a fantasy. This
            could be reading, watching TV, going for a walk or ringing a friend.
            Anything that takes your thoughts away from that fantasy and engages
            your brain.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Relaxation</h5>

          <p>
            Engage in a relaxation technique that works for you. This should be
            planned and rehearsed in advance. Techniques include, for example,
            guided visualisation, breathing exercises, mindfulness or yoga.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Challenging your thoughts</h5>
          <p>
            You can ask yourself questions to remind yourself of the
            consequences of engaging in the thought/fantasy or behaviour. Be
            firm with yourself. ‘Why am I having this thought, fantasy or urge;
            what good is it actually going to do me?’
          </p>
          <p>
            You could also ask about the consequences to implant fear. ‘What
            would happen if someone walked in and could see what I was thinking
            about?’ ‘I know if I keep having this thought, I am more likely to
            act on this fantasy; what are the consequences if I was caught?’.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Fantasy replacement</h5>
          <p>
            Change the ending or the subject of your fantasy. For example, if
            you are beginning to indulge in fantasy about a child you have seen,
            change the child to an adult. In order to gain the same
            satisfaction, this will probably not be an immediate solution, but
            you could start by changing small features like hairstyle or body
            form and over time change the whole situation. In contrast, try a
            different fantasy all together which is new and exciting…. and
            healthy!
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Fantasy blockers</h5>
          <p>
            Imagine someone walking in to your fantasy and catching you. This
            person has to be someone who you would never want to find out, like
            a close friend or family member. Or maybe the police. Note that this
            technique should not be used if you are aroused by the idea of
            someone finding out.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Urge surfing</h5>
          <p>
            Imagine your fantasy as being like a giant wave. It will build and
            build to a peak and then suddenly go the other way and decline in
            intensity. If you do not masturbate, eventually the urge to do so
            will go away. This happens with all urges, not just sexual urges;
            for example if you are craving chocolate, eventually this craving
            will go away. Urges never stay, they usually are at their worst for
            20 minutes. Reminding yourself that it will pass can be a helpful
            way to stop yourself from acting on it.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Self-care</h5>
          <p>
            As a long term strategy then eating well, exercising, sleeping and
            relaxation; all of these contribute to a happier, healthier you. If
            you ensure all these are in check, you will find managing sexual
            fantasies much easier. You can look back to the self-care module for
            more information.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Praise your success</h5>
          <p>
            The most important thing is to praise yourself for your success. If
            you are able to stop a particular fantasy, congratulate yourself.
            Treat yourself to something nice to eat or do something you enjoy.
            Stopping fantasies can be difficult, especially if you are used to
            having them, so you need to give yourself credit for that.

          <h4 className="secondary-color">Common thinking errors</h4>
          <p>
            Sometimes how you think about a situation can impact on your ability
            to successfully address thinking patterns or behaviour. These are
            known as common thinking errors.
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              ‘All or nothing’ thinking – For example I will never masturbate
              again to stop my attraction to children without thinking of how to
              manage sexual needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Over-generalising – over generalising from one specific
              experience/situation to expectations of future experiences e.g. I
              couldn’t stop my fantasy so I won’t try again.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shoulds/musts – rigid expectations of what you or others should
              do, or of what should happen in life. This can include the things
              that you believe ‘must’ happen in order for you to be happy e.g. I
              have to have a sexual relationship to be happy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Selective filtering – only paying attention to certain types of
              information (typically discounting positive information) e.g. a
              particular person rejected me
            </li>
            <li>
              Jumping to conclusions – e.g. thinking this is just the way I am.
            </li>
            <li>
              Catastrophizing – over-reacting to perceived negative events or
              setbacks, e.g. a lapse results in giving up.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Read through the common thinking errors below and see if any apply
            to you.&nbsp; When you notice yourself thinking in this way,
            challenge the thought by asking yourself how true it is, what
            evidence you have to support it and whether you have any
            counter-evidence to suggest the thought is not based in truth. Think
            about how you can replace the thinking error with more realistic
            thoughts.
