          <h4 className="secondary-color">Management strategies</h4>
          <p>
            So you have identified how your thoughts, feelings, and behaviours
            are connected. You may have identified some thoughts or behaviours
            you want to manage including inappropriate sexual thoughts. We are
            now going to focus on strategies to manage them. For some people
            this will be easy, but for others it will take time, and hard work.
            You are not alone if you feel it is too hard to control these
            thoughts, fantasies and behaviours but{" "}
            <strong>YOU ARE IN CONTROL</strong>
            &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>you can make a choice</strong>&nbsp;as to how
            much attention you choose to give to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next time you have an unhealthy thought, urge, or behaviour, you can
            try to use one of these to help you stop. The more you use these,
            the more you will learn what works more effectively for you. It may
            be that you need to practice them or use a combination of these to
            find the best way for you.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Escape route</h5>
          <p>
            Sometimes we need to remove ourselves from the situation in which we
            are fantasising. Get up, get out of that room, leave the house if
            you have to. Go anywhere that stops you from having that sexual
            fantasy. Put yourself around people so that you can’t masturbate.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Active distraction</h5>

          <p>
            Do something that prevents you from thinking about a fantasy. This
            could be reading, watching TV, going for a walk or ringing a friend.
            Anything that takes your thoughts away from that fantasy and engages
            your brain.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Relaxation</h5>

          <p>
            Engage in a relaxation technique that works for you. This should be
            planned and rehearsed in advance. Techniques include, for example,
            guided visualisation, breathing exercises, mindfulness or yoga.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find more guidance on some of these techniques in the{" "}

              <b>self-care strategies </b>
            </Link>
            section.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Challenging your thoughts</h5>
          <p>
            You can ask yourself questions to help challenge this thought e.g.,
            it is true; what evidence do you have which proves this thought
            isn't true. It may be helpful to remind yourself of the consequences
            of engaging in the thought/fantasy or behaviour. Be firm with
            yourself. ‘Why am I having this thought, fantasy or urge; what are
            the negative outcomes of engaging in this?'
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I know if I keep having this thought, I am more likely to act on
            this fantasy; what are the consequences if I was caught?’. Remind
            yourself of why you are motivated to manage these thoughts, urges,
            and/or behaviours. It may be helpful to have some challenges written
            down somewhere to remind you of them.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Fantasy replacement</h5>
          <p>
            Change the ending or the subject of your fantasy. For example, if
            you are beginning to indulge in fantasy about a child you have seen,
            change the child to an adult. In contrast, try a different fantasy
            all together which is new and exciting…. and healthy!
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Fantasy blockers</h5>
          <p>
            Imagine someone walking in to your fantasy and catching you. This
            person has to be someone who you would never want to find out, like
            a close friend or family member. Or maybe the police. Note that this
            technique should not be used if you are aroused by the idea of
            someone finding out.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Urge surfing</h5>
          <p>
            Imagine your fantasy as being like a giant wave. It will build and
            build to a peak and then suddenly go the other way and decline in
            intensity. If you do not masturbate, eventually the urge to do so
            will go away. This happens with all urges, not just sexual urges;
            for example if you are craving chocolate, eventually this craving
            will go away. Urges never stay, they usually are at their worst for
            20 minutes. Reminding yourself that it will pass can be a helpful
            way to stop yourself from acting on it.
          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Self-care</h5>
          <p>
            Eating well, exercising, sleeping and relaxation; all of these
            contribute to a happier, healthier you. If you ensure all these are
            in check, you will find managing sexual fantasies much easier. You
            can look back to the self-care module for more information.

          </p>
          <h5 className="secondary-color">Praise your success</h5>
          <p>
            The most important thing is to praise yourself for your success. If
            you are able to stop a particular fantasy, congratulate yourself.
            Treat yourself to something nice to eat or do something you enjoy.
            Stopping fantasies can be difficult, especially if you are used to
            having them, so you need to give yourself credit for that.

          <h4 className="secondary-color">Common thinking errors</h4>
          <p>
            Sometimes how you think about a situation can impact on your ability
            to successfully address thinking patterns or behaviour. These are
            known as common thinking errors.
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              ‘All or nothing’ thinking – For example I will never masturbate
              again to stop my attraction to children without thinking of how to
              manage sexual needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Over-generalising – over generalising from one specific
              experience/situation to expectations of future experiences e.g. I
              couldn’t stop my fantasy so I won’t try again.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shoulds/musts – rigid expectations of what you or others should
              do, or of what should happen in life. This can include the things
              that you believe ‘must’ happen in order for you to be happy e.g. I
              have to have a sexual relationship to be happy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Selective filtering – only paying attention to certain types of
              information (typically discounting positive information) e.g. a
              particular person rejected me
            </li>
            <li>
              Jumping to conclusions – e.g. thinking this is just the way I am.
            </li>
            <li>
              Catastrophizing – over-reacting to perceived negative events or
              setbacks, e.g. a lapse results in giving up.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Read through the common thinking errors above and see if any apply
            to you.&nbsp; When you notice yourself thinking in this way,
            challenge the thought by asking yourself how true it is, what
            evidence you have to support it and whether you have any
            counter-evidence to suggest the thought is not based in truth. Think
            about how you can replace the thinking error with more realistic
            thoughts.
