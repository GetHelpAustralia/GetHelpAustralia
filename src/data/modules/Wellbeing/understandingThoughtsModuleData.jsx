          <p>
            Although sexual behaviour can be influenced by numerous factors, it
            is not outside of your control. Sexual offending is not something
            that just happens on the spur of moment and often appears as a cycle
            or pattern that can become automatic and can occur repeatedly,
            becoming somewhat part of a routine.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">Understanding thoughts</h4>
          <p>
            Thoughts include all mental activity; ideas, opinions, beliefs,
            values, judgements and impressions. Thoughts are the voice in our
            head which govern what we do. We are not always aware of our
            thoughts but they are always there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thoughts can be automatic, fleeting or more prolonged. Thought
            processes provide us with the capacity to reason, use logic, common
            sense and put ideas together. Your mind is seldom empty of thoughts;
            even when you are asleep your mind is active.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">Understanding feelings</h4>
          <p>
            Feelings are emotions and moods that often occur after thoughts and
            are internal reactions to things going on around and within us.
            Thoughts and feelings are closely linked; either one may happen
            first, closely followed by the other.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">Understanding behaviour</h4>
          <p>
            Behaviour is what you do; your actions as a result of what you think
            and feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behaviour, thoughts and feelings are connected. Problematic sexual
            behaviour is influenced by problematic sexual thoughts and feelings,
            so in order to stop this behaviour, it is important to become aware
            of the nature of the thoughts and feelings and to manage/change
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diagram below demonstrates how thoughts, feelings and behaviour
            are connected, and interact and influence one another. Sometimes
            people are able to take responsibility for their behaviour but
            struggle to understand the thoughts and feelings that were driving
            the behaviour. If you have engaged in problematic behaviour, these
            modules can help you to explore the thoughts and feelings
            underpinning that behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are worried about your sexual thoughts, but have not acted on
            those thoughts, we hope these modules will help you to gain a
            greater understanding and put measures in place to manage them.

          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              Think of an example of a situation that does not relate to sexual
              offending behaviour, e.g. going to the office party or attending a
              job interview.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify some&nbsp;<strong>negative thoughts </strong>about the
              situation, e.g. ‘ I won’t know anyone there’ and ‘What’s the
              point? I am not going to get the job anyway’.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then identify the types of feelings that are associated with these
              thoughts and how they will affect the way you behave in these
              situations. For example feeling anxious and therefore not talking
              to people at the party or feeling sad and coming across as
              unenthusiastic about the job.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using the same example, apply&nbsp;
              <strong>positive thoughts </strong>and observe the differences in
              your feelings and behaviour. For example thinking ‘I love parties
              and meeting new people’, feeling excited and approaching people to
              talk to them or thinking ‘I would be great at this job’, feeling
              confident and talking enthusiastically about why you’d be good at
              the job.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You need to change the problematic thoughts and feelings which
            influence your behaviour.

            Think about your unhelpful sexual thoughts by answering these
            questions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>How often do you have sexual thoughts about children?</li>
            <li>
              Does anything in particular trigger your sexual thoughts about
              children? For example a sight, sound, an image, a person, mood or
              situation, use of pornography.
            </li>
            <li>At what time of day do they happen?</li>
            <li>What feelings do you experience?</li>
            <li>
              What do you say to yourself when you have sexual thoughts about
              children?
            </li>
            <li>
              What do you feel like doing when you have sexual thoughts about
              children?
            </li>
            <li>
              How often do you masturbate to sexual fantasies about children?
            </li>
            <li>Do you have any other sexual thoughts that concern you?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            From the answers to these questions you will have started to
            identify your pattern of thoughts, feelings and behaviour. Remember
            that sexual thoughts, whatever they are, don’t determine behaviour
            by themselves. It is possible to manage the sexual thoughts that
            concern you.

          <p>
            In this section, when we are talking about ‘sexual fantasy’, we are
            referring to something that is imagined which you find sexually
            arousing.
          </p>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">What is a sexual fantasy?</h4>
          <p>
            A fantasy is something we imagine. It is more than just a fleeting
            thought. A fantasy is usually a longer scenario we play out in our
            mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            It could be thinking about a specific person, someone you know or
            imaginary, or even be about you in a scenario on your own. It might
            be about a situation that could possibly happen in the future,
            re-running something in your head that you have seen or that has
            happened to you before (e.g., fantasising about a scene in a movie
            or about someone you met) or something sexual that you don’t think
            could ever realistically happen in real life (e.g., having sex with
            a famous person or having superhuman powers).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to recognise that sexual fantasy can involve
            thinking about things, people or situations that would not
            necessarily be obviously sexual to other people.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">Why do people have fantasies?</h4>
          <p>
            Fantasies can be about a variety of different things and everybody
            will have their own reasons for engaging in a fantasy. They often
            fit into one of these reasons:
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              For some, a fantasy will give them&nbsp;
              <strong>confidence</strong>, increased&nbsp;
              <strong>self-assurance&nbsp;</strong>and a&nbsp;
              <strong>sense of control</strong>&nbsp;over a situation by letting
              them rehearse how they will deal with a situation.
            </li>
            <li>
              For others, it may be a form of&nbsp;
              <strong>stress release</strong>(escapism) or a way to&nbsp;
              <strong>experience things</strong>&nbsp;that they wouldn’t in
              everyday life.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some people use sexual fantasies to&nbsp;
              <strong>cope with negative emotions</strong>, like loneliness or
              rejection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Negative fantasies can be a way people try&nbsp;
              <strong>to cope&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;
              <strong>prepare themselves</strong>&nbsp;for something they fear
              will happen, or a way of&nbsp;<strong>punishing</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Some people use sexual fantasies as a form of&nbsp;
              <strong>sexual outlet</strong>; often if they are not meeting
              their sexual needs within a relationship.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Some fantasies are planned,&nbsp;rehearsed&nbsp;and&nbsp;used
            repeatedly, especially if it is really enjoyable, sometimes a
            person’s thoughts stray and it takes them a short time to realise
            they are fantasising and not doing what they are supposed to be
            doing.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">Fantasy and sexual arousal</h4>
          <p>
            A sexual fantasy can lead to a physical response in our body and/or
            a bodily response can trigger a sexual fantasy. Often, this bodily
            response is sexual arousal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sexual arousal can be considered as a continuum, which begins with
            the trigger of the arousal (a ‘stimulus’ that starts the arousal).
            This could be something external in your environment, like seeing
            someone you find attractive, or it could be something internal in
            your mind, like a spontaneous memory. Arousal increases if you act
            on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you engage in a sexual fantasy, masturbate or look
            at sexual images, the arousal will continue to increase until it
            plateaus for a while. Continuing to engage with the fantasy or
            sexual behaviour can lead to orgasm, followed by a decrease in
            arousal.
          </p>
          <p className="text-center">
            <img
              src="https://www.stopitnow.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/level-of-control.png"

              width="720"
              height="548"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the initial sexual arousal may not be a reaction you can
            control, all along the continuum, the arousal can be controlled and
            interrupted – if you wish to do so – right up until the point of
            orgasm has begun. However, the desire and motivation to stop the
            process typically reduces the further along the continuum you allow
            yourself to progress.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">
            Recognising if a sexual fantasy is unhealthy
          </h4>
          <p>
            Whether a particular fantasy is considered ‘unhealthy’ can vary from
            person to person; for example, it is more appropriate for a
            20-year-old person to have sexual fantasies about an 18-year-old,
            than a 60-year-old person.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also fantasies that strengthen attraction to children. For
            example if you fantasise about having sex with your partner who is
            dressed in school uniform, or doing a role play of a adult/child
            relationship e.g. father/daughter or teacher/pupil then for someone
            who has a sexual interest in children, it may be unhelpful as it
            might reinforce the attraction or increase the desire towards
            children. This can be amplified if the fantasy is acted out with the
            partner.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">My fantasies</h4>
          <p>
            A good starting point in considering if your fantasies are
            problematic is to look at your fantasies in more detail. The
            exercises below will help you to start to doing this by exploring
            your triggers to your fantasies.
