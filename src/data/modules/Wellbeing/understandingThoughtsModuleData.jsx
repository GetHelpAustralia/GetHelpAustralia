            Although sexual behaviour can be influenced by numerous factors, it
            is not outside of your control. Sexual offending is not something
            that just happens on the spur of moment and often appears as a cycle
            or pattern that can become automatic and can occur repeatedly,
            becoming somewhat part of a routine.
          </p>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">Understanding thoughts</h4>
          <p>
            Thoughts include all mental activity; ideas, opinions, beliefs,
            values, judgements and impressions. Thoughts are the voice in our
            head which govern what we do. We are not always aware of our
            thoughts but they are always there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thoughts can be automatic, fleeting or more prolonged. Thought
            processes provide us with the capacity to reason, use logic, common
            sense and put ideas together. Your mind is seldom empty of thoughts;
            even when you are asleep your mind is active.
          </p>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">Understanding feelings</h4>
          <p>
            Feelings are emotions and moods that often occur after thoughts and
            are internal reactions to things going on around and within us.
            Thoughts and feelings are closely linked; either one may happen
            first, closely followed by the other.
          </p>
          <h4 className="secondary-color">Understanding behaviour</h4>
          <p>
            Behaviour is what you do; your actions as a result of what you think
            and feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behaviour, thoughts and feelings are connected. Problematic sexual
            behaviour is influenced by problematic sexual thoughts and feelings,
            so in order to stop this behaviour, it is important to become aware
            of the nature of the thoughts and feelings and to manage/change
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diagram below demonstrates how thoughts, feelings and behaviour
            are connected, and interact and influence one another. Sometimes
            people are able to take responsibility for their behaviour but
            struggle to understand the thoughts and feelings that were driving
            the behaviour. If you have engaged in problematic behaviour, these
            modules can help you to explore the thoughts and feelings
            underpinning that behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are worried about your sexual thoughts, but have not acted on
            those thoughts, we hope these modules will help you to gain a
            greater understanding and put measures in place to manage them.
