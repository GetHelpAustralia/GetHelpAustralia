            ‘Change’ means different things for different people and each person
            will have different goals when using this guide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people will recognise they need to change harmful behaviours,
            such as viewing sexual images of children or others will want to
            change their thinking patterns or fantasies.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some people, change will mean feeling better or spending less
            time on inappropriate sexual thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working on these problems can be difficult and distressing, as is
            often the case with personal growth and change. Change happens over
            time, rather than suddenly. As this process happens, a person’s
            motivation changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Choosing to use this guide is an important first step, and working
            through it will increase your understanding and awareness. Take one
            step at a time and don’t rush through the guide. You need to engage
            in the work and reflect on your life. It has taken a long time to
            get where you are and change can take time too. Don’t be hard on
            yourself if it doesn’t happen overnight. People who struggle with
            sexual thoughts or behaviour towards children often have feelings of
            fear, guilt, and shame. This can reduce their self-esteem and hopes
            for the future. You can find more about{" "}

            A framework for discussing the motivation to change is the{" "}
            <u>Stages of Change Model</u>. They outline six stages.
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              Pre-contemplation: a person is not aware there is a problem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contemplation: a person is aware of a problem and starting to
              think about making a change.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preparation: a person is planning to make a change, finding
              support groups or talking to people about making changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Action: a person is starting the new behaviour or stopping
              negative ones, attending support groups, completing self-help
              modules, calling the Stop It Now! helpline!
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintenance: a person doesn’t engage in old behaviour and has
              moved to a new normal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lapse/Relapse:{" "}
              <span>
                a person has returned to old behaviours, either as a one-off
                (lapse) or for longer (relapse). This does not always happen,
                but if a lapse occurs, you can choose to move back into the
                ‘action’ phase, rather than go into{" "}

              <span>a complete relapse.</span>

          <h4 className="secondary-color">Setting goals</h4>
          <p>
            By using this website, you have recognised that you have a behaviour
            you want to change and are at least in the preparation stage. Move
            into action and start these self-help modules today. Anyone who
            commits themselves to change is able to change, even if they have
            tried in the past without success. With the right tools, you can
            move forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to take one step at a time, do not rush through it. Our
            role is to ask the right questions not give you the answers; you
            need to engage in the work and reflect on your life.

          <h5 className="secondary-color">My goals exercise</h5>
          <p>
            Spend some time thinking about some positive goals that will help
            you move towards being the person you want to be. It is important to
            set goals in manageable bite-size ways that make them more
            achievable which, in turn, makes change even more likely.
          </p>
          <p>
            It may help you to focus on the following five key areas of
            well-being; routine, sleep, nutrition, movement and social contact.
            When we are not feeling our best, these things tend to slip but when
            we are at our most peaceful, it’s usually because the above needs
            are being met.
          </p>
          <p>Example: My goals for the next week</p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              Routine: I will get up at 7am every day, and have a list of things
              I will do in the day such as washing or cleaning, which I will
              tick off once completed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sleep: I will not go online after 9pm, I will create a sleep
              routine (for example, hot drink, bath, reading) and be in bed by
              11pm.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nutrition: I will eat three meals per day and cook one healthy
              meal per week.
            </li>
            <li>Movement: I will go for a 10-minute walk each day.</li>
            <li>
              Contact: I will call a friend I haven’t spoken to recently, or
              talk to someone serving me in a shop.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can achieve these goals and you have taken the first step to
            change. Be proud that you have started this journey and let us
            support you as you take the next steps.

            It can also be useful to make some changes specifically connected to
            problematic behaviour. Some examples might include:

          <ul className="content-list">

            </li>
            <li>
              changing your laptop, phone or tablet wallpaper or screensaver to
              a photo of someone who is important to you, and who would be
              supportive of the changes you are making
            </li>
            <li>
              read books which could help you to understand compulsive behaviour
              (for example, In the Shadows of the Net: Breaking free from
              compulsive behaviour)
            </li>
            <li>
              reducing how much alcohol you drink, for example, having three
              alcohol-free days or not going online after drinking alcohol
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are a few examples but you are the expert on your life and in
            knowing what changes you could put in place today.

            If your risky or illegal behaviour happens online, there are lots of
            options to consider such as only going online in public spaces or
            when other people are nearby. If you are concerned about your
            pornography use, there are several apps which could be helpful such

            If you have people you can talk to about the changes you want to
            make, it’s a good idea to include them in your plan. It’s helpful to
            have someone to check in with and keep you on track when you’re
            making changes. If you can, share your plan with your supporters and
            ask them to see how you’re doing. They might also give you some
            advice. For example, if you set a goal to join a new club to make
            more friends, your supporters might notice that you’re feeling more
            confident. Hearing their thoughts can help you stay motivated, so
            don’t hesitate to ask them how you’re doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s also important to notice your own progress and give yourself a
            pat on the back. We suggest taking a moment every day or every few
            days to look at your goals. If you haven’t reached them, think about
            what made it tough and how you can overcome those challenges. And if
            you have succeeded, don’t forget to praise yourself and acknowledge
            your progress. You can keep adding new goals as you achieve your
            current ones.
