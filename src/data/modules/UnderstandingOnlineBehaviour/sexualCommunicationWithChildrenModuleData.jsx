            What do we mean by ‘sexual communication’?
          </h4>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            In Australia, an adult is committing a criminal offence if they
            intentionally communicate with a child for the purposes of sexual
            gratification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sexual communication with a child is often referred to as online
            grooming. It can take many forms and with different motivations. All
            forms are regarded as child sexual abuse. They are illegal and cause
            harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people communicate sexually with a child or children online
            because they find it sexually arousing. Other people do so in order
            to persuade children to send them sexual images or videos of
            themselves. Some people communicate sexually with children online
            because they want to meet the child offline in order to sexually
            interact with them. And some people say they communicate with
            children online to get a sense of connection. These behaviours can
            overlap, so that it’s not always clear at the outset what someone
            really wants from their sexual communication, but we do know all of
            these behaviours are illegal and harmful.
          </p>
          <p>
            People’s behaviour varies too. For example, many people engaging in
            this behaviour report having sexual contact with lots of children
            online, and sending sexual pictures of themselves to the children,
            too. Other people may communicate sexually with only one child.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some introduce the topic of sex very quickly, whereas others will
            engage in ‘grooming behaviours’, where they spend time building
            rapport and establishing trust with a child before the issue of sex
            is raised.

            Different stages of sexual communication with children
          </h4>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            In order to understand more about how to avoid situations which may
            lead to you communicating sexually with a child in the future, it
            can be helpful to understand that the behaviour happens in stages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people start communicating with children about general topics.
            This communication may continue for a while and may escalate to
            include sexual content. Some individuals may attempt to meet with
            the child. During conversations some individuals may go to great
            lengths to hide this behaviour from others and avoid detection. It
            is important to recognise that each of these stages are part of the
            offending behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that not every stage will be relevant for everyone. For
            example, some people do not try to make friends with the child
            concerned, or to form a relationship with them. But other people do.
            The difference often says a lot about people’s motivations.
          </p>
          <p>
            To change behaviour, it is important to recognise and understand the
            patterns in past behaviour. This can help us know the signs of the
            behaviour repeating itself and help us think about how we can
            prevent it from happening again.
          </p>
          <p>Consider reflecting on the following:</p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>What stage did you start with?</li>
            <li>How did you move through the stages?</li>
            <li>
              What patterns can you recognise in your offending behaviour?
            </li>
            <li>
              What can you put in place to ensure that this does not happen
              again?
            </li>

          <h4 className="secondary-color">The cycle of online grooming</h4>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Some people find it more helpful to think of their behaviour as
            following a repeated pattern rather than, for example, the stages
            set out previously. As with the stages mentioned previously,
            considering your behaviour patterns can help you to understand the
            form your behaviour took, and the factors involved in your decision
            making. This will put you in a position where you can recognise this
            and change your behaviour so it is not repeated in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cycle below is based on the work of de Santisteban et al (2018).
            Just like with the stages above, how a person moves through the
            cycle will be unique to them, and is likely to have changed over
            time as their behaviour developed. Not every stage will apply to
            everyone.

            Exercise 3: Cycle of online grooming
          </h4>
          <p>
            Look at the cycle below and think about how each stage might have
            applied to your online sexual behaviour towards a particular child
            or children, in general. You might also find it useful to consider
            one of the examples from earlier and how this person might apply to
            the cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you do this exercise, think about how your behaviour changed over
            time. Which stages of the cycle were most relevant for you? How has
            your thinking changed? How did the sexual communication arise? What
            do you think of your old justifications now?
          </p>
          <p>
            A full description of each of the stages of the cycle are outlined
            below.

            <h5 className="secondary-color">The online environment</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as ideas like the Triple A model, this is about how people
            perceive the internet as a place where they can express themselves
            sexually more openly. For example, some people might feel more
            confident talking to adults and/or children about sex online than
            offline. Or they might feel that they can portray themselves with
            more confidence or as being more attractive etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Contact with child or children</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is about how people make their initial contact with children
            online.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Initial engagement</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            Although persuasion may occur throughout someone’s contact with
            children, we know that people can engage a child or children in
            conversation, for example, by the use of a false profile, by using
            the language of children or adolescents.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">
              Finding out more about the child
            </h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            Having started the initial conversation, some adults may take an
            interest in other aspects of the child’s life. This is about
            strengthening their relationship with the child.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Strategies of persuasion</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            This stage is about how someone might persuade a child to do what
            they want them to, such as to send sexual images or videos of
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Sexual outcomes</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the sexual behaviour itself, for example, the exchange of
            sexual videos and images; offline sexual contact; one-off sexual
            encounters; sustained sexual contact with the same child over time
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Justifications</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            These are the things people say to themselves to justify their
            behaviour and to feel OK about it. These might include:
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              <em>blaming</em>&nbsp;the child – ‘s/he led me on!’
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>sexualising</em>&nbsp;the child – ‘s/he was so provocative’,
              ‘s/he was sexually active anyway’
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>desirability</em>&nbsp;– believing themselves to be attractive
              and desirable
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>equating</em>&nbsp;children to adults, for example, in terms
              of consent and understanding.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The idea is that these justifications then make it more likely that
            the person will carry on with their behaviour, and so go back round
            the cycle, perhaps many times.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to recognise these justifications, so that you can
            challenge them in the future. Once you have identified some of the
            justifications you used, you could consider a response to dissuade
            yourself from engaging in the behaviour in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the table below to consider your justifications at the time and
            responses now. You should repeat all the phrases you write in the
            “Responses” column in your head, so that this sort of thinking
            becomes automatic if you start to experience the justifications
            again.

            Considering the child’s perspective
          </h4>
          <p>
            Many people do not believe they are harming children when they
            communicate with them sexually on the internet, and can incorrectly
            blame the child. However, we know this is not true. Speaking to a
            child about sexually explicit content before they are emotionally
            developed has long-term, harmful consequences on the cognitive and
            sexual development of these children.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            If you recognise using any justifications, it is important to think
            about the dynamics of your interaction or relationship with the
            children concerned. This can be really hard to do, as sometimes
            people feel ashamed of their behaviour when they look at it from the
            child’s point of view. But, remember that this is a positive
            process, and considering the child’s point of view may help you
            prevent inappropriate online behaviour going forward.{" "}

          <p>
            Consider what you know about the child/ren you were interacting with
            and what you know about children generally. Think about the

          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              What might have made it difficult for them to say ‘no’?(e.g.
              worry/anxiety, lack of assertiveness, fear of the person or losing
              the relationship)
            </li>
            <li>
              What needs could your contact with the child have been meeting for
              them? (e.g. perhaps they wanted attention as a result of an
              unhappy home life)

            Understanding more about your behaviour online can help you to
            consider what changes you need to make to stop the behaviour and
            move forward positively. You can use the information from the other
            modules to help you consider what to put in place and how to move
            forward. You might find it particularly useful to consider the
            following modules:&nbsp;
