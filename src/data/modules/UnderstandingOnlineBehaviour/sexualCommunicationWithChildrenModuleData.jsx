            What do we mean by ‘sexual communication’?
          </h4>
          <p>
            In Australia, an adult is committing a criminal offence if they
            intentionally communicate with someone under the age of 16 years for
            the purposes of sexual gratification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sexual communication with a child is often referred to as online
            grooming. It can take many forms and with different motivations. All
            forms are regarded as child sexual abuse. They are illegal and cause
            harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people communicate sexually with a child or children online
            because they find it sexually arousing. Other people do so in order
            to persuade children to send them sexual images or videos of
            themselves. Some people communicate sexually with children online
            because they want to meet the child offline in order to sexually
            interact with them. These behaviours can overlap, so that it’s not
            always clear at the outset what someone really wants from their
            sexual communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            People’s behaviour varies too. For example, many people engaging in
            this behaviour report having sexual contact with lots of children
            online, and sending sexual pictures of themselves to the children,
            too. Other people may communicate sexually with only one child.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some introduce the topic of sex very quickly, whereas others will
            engage in ‘grooming behaviours’, where they spend time building
            rapport and establishing trust with a child before the issue of sex
            is raised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below are some examples of people who have engaged in sexual
            communication with children online, which show the different aspect
            of the behaviour.

            <h5 className="secondary-color">Mick</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            Mick is married, in his late 40s, and has three children aged 7-12.
            Until recently he was working in a stressful job as a manager in the
            hospitality industry. He has viewed adult pornography, on and off,
            ever since he was a teenager. In recent years he has started to use
            adult chat rooms as a sexual outlet, and, on occasions, he has
            engaged with teenage girls via webcam i.e. encouraged them to
            masturbate on camera and exposed himself to them. He has never
            attempted to meet up with any adults or children offline, and has
            had no interest in doing so. For Mick, his sexual interactions with
            adults and teenage girls online were a way for him to use sex to
            de-stress in the evenings when the rest of his family were asleep.

            <h5 className="secondary-color">Ben</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ben is a gay man in his 30s.&nbsp;He has no children and works in
            financial services. He has a limited history of adult relationships
            and has not been in a relationship for some years, about which he
            has felt frustrated and anxious. In recent months, using various
            social media platforms, he set up a fake profile of a teenage girl.
            Using this profile, he then contacted teenage boys online and, over
            time, would start to talk to the boys about their sexual behaviour,
            fantasies and so on. Ben made no attempt to meet the boys offline –
            after all, he was pretending to be a teenage girl. Ben found these
            sexual conversations with boys arousing and he also enjoyed the
            challenge of getting the boys to talk about their sexual behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Rob</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            Rob is in his mid-40s&nbsp;and works at his local supermarket. He
            lives alone and has only had one relationship in his life, which
            ended many years ago when his partner was unfaithful to him with one
            of his friends. Rob has been wary of meeting anyone new ever since.
            However, over the last 3 years, through social media, he started to
            chat to others online. Rob wasn’t looking to get into a relationship
            and enjoyed talking to a wide range of people. He especially liked
            to give support to young people who were struggling with their
            mental health, as he felt like he had relevant experiences he could
            share. Over time, he became close to a 15-year-old girl called
            Claire, who was experiencing bullying at school. Rob and Claire
            spent a lot of time talking via a messaging platform, especially in
            the evenings. After some months, Rob felt that he had fallen in love
            with Claire. He shared his feelings with her, and said that he felt
            they were meant to be together as a couple. To his delight, and
            relief, Claire said that she felt the same, and they agreed to go
            away for a weekend, in secret.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">John</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            John is aged 28. He lives in a house-share and works as a software
            developer. He has always viewed adult pornography and has had a lot
            of sexual partners in recent years. John enjoys partying, and uses
            recreational drugs most weekends. He feels like he’s too young to
            settle down, and sex is an important part of his lifestyle. John has
            various profiles on numerous dating Apps and social media platforms,
            which he uses to find new sexual partners and/or to engage in
            cybersex. John is most attracted to women aged 18-24 but knows that
            some of the girls he has chatted to online have been as young as 14.
            Some weeks ago, he also met up with a girl, who he now thinks was
            under-age, and had sex with her in a hotel.

            Considering these examples, did you recognise any of your own
            behaviours? Were you able to relate to any aspects of the person’s
            situation?

            Motivations for engaging in sexual communication with children
          </h4>
          <p>
            Some people tell us that their interaction with children was not
            only motivated by sex. Instead some people talk about wanting to
            feel understood, or enjoying the connection with the child they are
            speaking to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our experience is that people’s motivations are often about more
            things than simply sexual pleasure. As such, it is important to
            consider your motives, so that you are able to manage your behaviour
            more responsibly in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the motivations noted in the&nbsp;'Understanding Why'
            module&nbsp;will also be relevant for people who have communicated
            sexually with children online. Take a look and see which might have
            been significant for you. You might find it helpful to complete the
            timeline exercise, if you haven’t done so already.

          <h4 className="secondary-color">Different groups</h4>
          <p>
            Research and practice concerning the online grooming of children is
            relatively new. We are therefore still learning about this
            behaviour, and the people who engage in it. Some researchers have
            suggested that people who sexually abuse children in this way fall
            into different groups, depending on their motives and behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            The European Online Grooming Project (Webster et al., 2012) proposes
            three broad groups:
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              People who want to feel close to a child – ‘intimacy seeking’
            </li>
            <li>
              People who adapt and change their online behaviour and profiles
              depending on the response of the child they are chatting to –
              ‘adaptable’
            </li>
            <li>
              People who act in a very sexual way from the outset –
              ‘hypersexual’
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The difference between these groups, in terms of their online
            behaviour, is mainly about the intensity and duration of the online
            communication between the adult and the child. The motivations,
            however, may differ.

            Exercise 1: Different approaches to children
          </h4>
          <p>
            With the above ideas about different groupings in mind, think about
            the following questions. Also consider if your behaviour changed
            over time, and why that might have been:
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              Did you think about your contact with a child or children as being
              consenting and intimate?
            </li>
            <li>
              Were your conversations prolonged and frequent with sexual content
              introduced slowly?
            </li>
            <li>
              Did your online conversations often lead to planning or arranging
              offline meetings to develop the relationship?
            </li>
            <li>
              Did your online conversations lead to the sending and/or receiving
              of sexual images?
            </li>
            <li>
              Did you see the children you spoke to as mature and sexually
              knowledgeable?
            </li>
            <li>
              Did you change your style of communication depending on the child
              you spoke to, and how they responded?
            </li>
            <li>
              Did you introduce sexual content very quickly i.e. within seconds
              or the first few minutes?
            </li>
            <li>Did you use a false identity?</li>
            <li>
              Did you try to develop a relationship with a particular child or
              children?
            </li>
            <li>Did you use sexual chat for your immediate sexual pleasure?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            What do your answers to the above questions, tell you about your
            motivations?
          </p>
          <p>
            What do they say about how you viewed the child or children you
            chatted to?
          </p>
          <p>
            And what was the likelihood of you meeting up with a child you had
            chatted to online? What stopped you?

            The different stages of sexual communication with children
          </h4>
          <p>
            In order to understand more about how to avoid situations which may
            lead to you communicating sexually with a child in the future, it
            can be helpful to break the process down into different stages, like
            those suggested below, based upon the work by Rachel O’Connell. We
            can consider each of these stages using one of the examples earlier,
            Rob:
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              Friendship forming stage –&nbsp;
              <em>
                Rob would provide support to young people who were struggling.
              </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              Relationship forming stage –&nbsp;
              <em>
                Rob continued this contact with Claire and communicated that he
                had feelings for her.
              </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoiding detection stage –&nbsp;
              <em>
                The messaging between Rob and Claire took place mostly in the
                evening. There was also a secret meeting planned.
              </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              Sexual behaviour stage –&nbsp;
              <em>
                An arrangement was made to meet, which could have resulted in
                Rob committing a contact sexual offence against Claire.
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="secondary-color">Exercise 2: My different stages</h4>
          <p>
            To change behaviour, it’s important to recognise and understand the
            patterns in past behaviour. This can help us know the signs of the
            behaviour repeating itself and help us think about how we can change
            for the better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking about your online behaviour, what examples can you identify
            for each stage?
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that not every stage will be relevant for everyone. For
            example, some people do not try to make friends with the child
            concerned, or to form a relationship with them. But other people do.
            The difference often says a lot about people’s motivations. You can

          <h4 className="secondary-color">The cycle of online grooming</h4>
          <p>
            Some people find it more helpful to think of their behaviour as
            following a repeated pattern rather than, for example, the stages
            set out above. As with the stages above, considering your behaviour
            patterns can help you to understand the form your behaviour took,
            and the factors involved in your decision making. This will put you
            in a position where you can recognise this and change your behaviour
            so it is not repeated in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cycle below is based on the work of de Santisteban et al (2018).
            Just like with the stages above, how a person moves through the
            cycle will be unique to them, and is likely to have changed over
            time as their behaviour developed. Not every stage will apply to
            everyone.

            Exercise 3: Cycle of online grooming
          </h4>
          <p>
            Look at the cycle below and think about how each stage might have
            applied to your online sexual behaviour towards a particular child
            or children, in general. You might also find it useful to consider
            one of the examples from earlier and how this person might apply to
            the cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you do this exercise, think about how your behaviour changed over
            time. Which stages of the cycle were most relevant for you? How has
            your thinking changed? How did the sexual communication arise? What
            do you think of your old justifications now?
          </p>

            Click on the stages of the cycle below for a full description of
            each stage.

            <h5 className="secondary-color">The online environment</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as ideas like the Triple A model, this is about how people
            perceive the internet as a place where they can express themselves
            sexually more openly. For example, some people might feel more
            confident talking to adults and/or children about sex online than
            offline. Or they might feel that they can portray themselves with
            more confidence or as being more attractive etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            To read more about the Triple A model, and consider these aspects of
            the internet, you might find it useful to look at the&nbsp;Online
            World module. (INSERT LINK)

          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Contact with child or children</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is about how people make their initial contact with children
            online.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Initial engagement</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            Although persuasion may occur throughout someone’s contact with
            children, we know that people can engage a child or children in
            conversation, for example, by the use of a false profile, by using
            the language of children or adolescents.
          </p>

            <h5 className="secondary-color">
              Finding out more about the child
            </h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            Having started the initial conversation, some adults may take an
            interest in other aspects of the child’s life. This is about
            strengthening their relationship with the child.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Strategies of persuasion</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            This stage is about how someone might persuade a child to do what
            they want them to, such as to send sexual images or videos of
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Sexual outcomes</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the sexual behaviour itself, for example, the exchange of
            sexual videos and images; offline sexual contact; one-off sexual
            encounters; sustained sexual contact with the same child over time
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h5 className="secondary-color">Justifications</h5>
          </p>
          <p>
            These are the things people say to themselves to justify their
            behaviour and to feel OK about it. These might include:
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              <em>blaming</em>&nbsp;the child – ‘s/he led me on!’
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>sexualising</em>&nbsp;the child – ‘s/he was so provocative’,
              ‘s/he was sexually active anyway’
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>desirability</em>&nbsp;– believing themselves to be attractive
              and desirable
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>equating</em>&nbsp;children to adults, for example, in terms
              of consent and understanding.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The idea is that these justifications then make it more likely that
            the person will carry on with their behaviour, and so go back round
            the cycle, perhaps many times.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to recognise these justifications, so that you can
            challenge them in the future. Once you have identified some of the
            justifications you used, you could consider a response to dissuade
            yourself from engaging in the behaviour in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the table below to consider your justifications at the time and
            responses now. You should repeat all the phrases you write in the
            “Responses” column in your head, so that this sort of thinking
            becomes automatic if you start to experience the justifications
            again.

            Considering the child’s perspective
          </h4>
          <p>
            Many people do not believe they are harming children when they
            communicate with them sexually on the internet. For example, do any
            of the following sound familiar?
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              “The girl/boy I was talking to really could have stopped it at any
              time. I never threatened her/him.”
            </li>
            <li>
              “S/He was usually the one to start chatting with me. I never
              pursued her/him.”
            </li>
            <li>
              “I know I wasn’t the first older man s/he’d had contact with. If
              she didn’t like it the first time, s/he wouldn’t have started
              chatting to me.”
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you recognise using any of the above statements, it is important
            to think about the dynamics of your interaction or relationship with
            the children concerned. This can be really hard to do, as sometimes
            people feel ashamed of their behaviour when they look at it from the
            child’s point of view. But, remember that this is a positive
            process, and considering the child’s point of view can help you stay
            safe from inappropriate online behaviour going forward.{" "}

            Exercise 4: The child’s perspective
          </h4>
          <p>
            Consider what you know about the child/ren you were interacting with
            and what you know about children generally. Think about the
            following discussion questions:
          </p>
          <ul className="content-list">
            <li>
              What might have made it difficult for them to say ‘no’?(e.g.
              worry/anxiety, lack of assertiveness, fear of the person or losing
              the relationship)
            </li>
            <li>
              What needs could your contact with the child have been meeting for
              them? (e.g. perhaps they wanted attention as a result of an
              unhappy home life)
            </li>
            <li>What responsibilities do all adults have towards children?</li>
            <li>
              How does a child’s understanding of sexual contact, its meaning
              and consequences, differ from the understanding of adults?
            </li>
            <li>
              How able is a child to give informed consent to any form of sexual
              contact? (e.g. does a child fully recognise the risks and
              consequences of sexual contact)
            </li>
            <li>
              How could your interaction with the child have made them believe
              they held some responsibility for the chat?

              What do you think motivated you to communicate with children in a

            Understanding more about your behaviour online can help you to

            forward. You might find it particularly useful to consider the
