            <p>
              When we encounter a situation in which our behaviour is
              inconsistent with our own or others’ beliefs and values, our minds
              tend to come up with false reasons for why our behaviour is okay.
              These reasons are called ‘justifications’, and they serve to make
              us feel more comfortable and give us permission to keep engaging
              in the behaviour even when it is harmful. It is a way to deflect
              responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we think back to the{" "}
              <Link to="/understanding-thoughts-feelings-and-behaviours">
                thoughts, feelings and behaviour section
              </Link>
              , we know our behaviour is the consequence of what we think and
              feel. So, if we are telling ourselves that something is okay, we
              are more likely to engage in that behaviour, even when it is
              harmful. These ‘making it okay’ statements we tell ourselves are
              justifications.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can sometimes be like having an internal monologue where you
              are battling between unhelpful and helpful thinking, like{" "}
              <Link to="/self-talk">self-talk</Link>. Justifications are
              unhelpful thinking as they give permission to do something we
              shouldn’t be doing. We can use helpful thinking to challenge these
              justifications.
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example</p>
            <div className="text-center">
              <img
              className="img-center img-responsive-90"
              src={image}
              alt="Justifications"
            />
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              People will be persuaded by their unhelpful thinking if their
              ‘yes’ justifications in favour of doing the behaviour are stronger
              than their ‘no’ challenges against the behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              Justifications include things like excuses, minimisations,
              exaggerations, denial and bits of information we choose to miss
              out or ignore.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all use justifications every day. If it’s raining outside, we
              might tell ourselves that we can’t run today. Justifications can
              be a barrier to making positive changes. The more you are aware of
              your unhelpful and helpful thinking, and the negative effects of
              offending for yourself and others, you will increase your ability
              and motivation to avoid further offending.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are some examples of statements that represent justification
              of behaviours. Have a think about what justifications you have
              used.
            </p>
            <ul className="content-list">
              <li>“It was only once in a while.”</li>
              <li>“At least I’m not as bad as so-and-so.”</li>
              <li>“I’m dealing with a lot of stress and need to unwind.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you identify with the statements in the list then justification
              could be helping you to keep doing a behaviour that you know is
              harmful.

            Exercise 1: Identifying and challenging your justifications
          </h4>
          <p>
            Use the table below to consider your justifications at the time you
            were engaging in harmful behaviour. Once you have identified what
            justifications you are using, it is important to think about how you
            can challenge these. For example, if you are justifying the
            behaviour by saying &quot;it was only once in a while&quot;, a
            potential challenge could be &quot;even if it&#39;s once in a while,
            it is still illegal and harmful&quot;. Once you begin to challenge
            these justifications, they have less power.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should repeat all the phrases you write in the “Challenges”
            column in your head, so that this sort of thinking becomes automatic
            if you start to experience the justifications again.

            As you work through the modules, have this list with you. The more
            you understand about your offending behaviours, the more unhelpful
            thinking you should recognise. By recognising and challenging these
            unhelpful thoughts the more likely you will be to manage your
            behaviours.
