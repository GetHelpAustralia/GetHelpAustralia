        <p>
          For some people, collecting – and cataloguing, organising and all the
          other stuff that goes with it – can seem a big part of their
          offending.

        <h4 className="secondary-color">Why do people collect?</h4>
        <p>There are lots of reasons why people collect things:</p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>They might like the sense of order and control</li>
          <li>
            They might like the ‘hunting’ part; tracking down something rare or
            ‘special’
          </li>
          <li>
            They might be proud of their collection and pleased that it’s
            ‘better’ than other people’s
          </li>
          <li>
            They might be reliving childhood experiences through collecting
          </li>
          <li>
            They might feel that this activity fills a part of them that they
            feel is otherwise missing
          </li>
          <li>
            They might feel that arranging and organising provides a safety
            zone; a place of refuge where fears are calmed and insecurity is
            managed
          </li>
          <li>
            They might like the social camaraderie when sharing their collection
            with other collectors
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ok, but what about you? Some of the above reasons may ring true, but
          there may be other reasons too, especially if you are collecting
          sexual images of children.

        <p>
          If you are collecting images of child sexual abuse, then this is
          always a problem because it is&nbsp;<strong>harmful</strong>&nbsp;to
          both&nbsp;
          <strong>you</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>children</strong>
          &nbsp;in the images.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collecting can also become a problem when it starts to negatively
          impact on the other things in your life, such as:
        </p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>
            You are not giving enough time to friends and family and prefer to
            spend your time collecting or feel distracted even when you’re with
            them
          </li>
          <li>You are unable to build new or sustain existing relationships</li>
          <li>
            You are unable to concentrate on your job or you are unable to hold
            down a job
          </li>
          <li>
            All of your available money is going on your collecting or you are
            unable to pay your bills or have debts because of it
          </li>
          <li>
            Although you may enjoy collecting, it also makes you feel stressed
            or worried about it

          Not everybody seen as a ‘problematic collector’ will find that their
          behaviour negatively affects all areas of their life. It might just be
          that it affects one area. By understanding why you collect and how it
          impacts on your life, you will recognise if it is something that you
          need to address.

          Why collect sexual Images of Children?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Of all the things you could collect, why collect child sexual abuse
          material (CSAM)?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people who collect sexual images of children say that it’s the
          collecting which is really important for them, that it’s not really a
          sexual thing at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that’s true of you, ask yourself the question:&nbsp; ‘why am I
          collecting sexual images and not stamps, for example?’
        </p>
        <p>
          We do everything for a reason. The reason that we do each thing is to
          serve some sort of function.
        </p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>You eat because you are hungry and it keeps you alive.</li>
          <li>You find a job, so that you can earn money to buy something.</li>
          <li>
            You join a club, because you want to make friends and build new
            relationships.
          </li>
          <li>
            You decide to walk home instead of drive, to get some exercise as
            you have been sitting at a desk all day.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every choice you make serves a function.</p>{" "}

            So, for this person it is clear to see that they feel in a low mood
            prior to working on their collection. During the collecting, their
            mood increases. Afterwards, their mood drops again; this may be due
            to the guilt of what they have been accessing online, but it also
            may be due to the fact they are simply not collecting at that time.

            The red line represents how they tend to feel on a day they are not

            their collection when they feel low and uses it to perk themselves
            back up; and on the days they feel OK, they tend not to collect.

            <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Be honest with yourself. You will never
            fully be able to understand your collecting if you aren’t
            acknowledging your true justifications.

          Use the first column in the table below to list your justifications.

          Then attempt to assume the role of someone who does not collect such
          images and consider whether or not they would accept your reasons for
          collecting. In the second column, write the response that you think
          the other person would give (you may want to try writing it out as a
          conversation between the two of you).

          Next time you consider collecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM),
          look back over this table and use the responses to challenge your
          behaviour.&nbsp;This can be a useful and effective short term
          deterrent.

            <strong>THINK</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;What needs does collecting meet
            for me?

          If you have identified that collecting in general meets certain needs
          for you, then you can replace collecting child sexual abuse material
          (CSAM) with something else that is healthy and appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If collecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is the only form of
          collecting that meets specific needs, then you will need to look at
          other ways to meet those needs.
