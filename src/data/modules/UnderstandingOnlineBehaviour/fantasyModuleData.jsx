        <h4 className="secondary-color">What is a fantasy?</h4>
        <p>
          Do you ever think about winning the lottery? How would you spend the
          money? Where would you go?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one example of a fantasy. A fantasy is something that is
          imagined.
        </p>
        <h2>Why do people have fantasies?</h2>
        <p>
          Fantasies can be about a range of different things and everybody will
          have their own reasons for engaging in a fantasy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some people, a fantasy will give them better confidence and
          a&nbsp;sense of control&nbsp;over a situation by letting them rehearse
          how they will deal with a situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For other people, it might be a way to release stress (escapism) or a
          way to experience things&nbsp;that they wouldn’t in everyday life
          (that lottery win).
        </p>
        <p>
          Negative fantasies can be a way that people try to
          cope&nbsp;and&nbsp;prepare themselves&nbsp;for something they fear
          will happen, or a way of&nbsp;punishing&nbsp;themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people use sexual fantasies as a form of&nbsp;sexual
          outlet,&nbsp;often if they are not meeting their sexual needs within a
          relationship.
        </p>
        <p>A fantasy can have:</p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>
            positive outcomes:&nbsp;for example imagining achieving an award or
            winning a competition.
          </li>
          <li>
            negative outcomes:&nbsp;for example if a partner does not return
            home on time, imaging that they have been in a car accident.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some fantasies are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            planned,&nbsp;rehearsed&nbsp;and&nbsp;used repeatedly by a person,
            for example scoring a world cup goal.
          </li>
          <li>
            triggered by an emotional response or something that happens, for
            example replaying bad day at work.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sometimes a person’s thoughts stray and it takes them a short time to
          realise they are fantasising and not doing what they are supposed to
          be doing.

        <h4 className="secondary-color">When fantasy becomes a problem</h4>
        <p>
          Fantasies are a healthy and normal part of everyday life and everybody
          fantasises about something at one point or another.
        </p>
        <p>But fantasies can become a problem when:</p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>
            you engage in fantasies for a long period of time and increasingly
            often
          </li>
          <li>
            you use fantasy to deal with a situation rather than resolving the
            problem itself
          </li>
          <li>
            you would rather engage in a sexual fantasy than engage in sexual
            activity with your partner
          </li>
          <li>
            your sexual fantasies are illegal, abusive or inappropriate
            (explored later)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you can identify with the bullet points above, then your fantasies
          may begin to affect the things you care about, such as your family,
          your friends, your job and your intimate and sexual relationships.
        </p>
        <h2>My fantasies</h2>
        <p>
          A good starting point in considering if your fantasies are problematic
          is to look at your fantasies in more detail. Exercises 1a and 1b will
          help you start to do this and will help you to explore your triggers
          to your fantasies.
        </p>
        <h2>Exercise 1A: Thinking about past fantasies</h2>
        <p>
          Think of a fantasy that you have had, either regularly or a one-off
          fantasy. It can be a non-sexual or sexual fantasy. Now answer the
          following questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Where were you when you were having this fantasy?</li>
          <li>
            Were there other people around? Were these people you know or
            strangers?
          </li>
          <li>What time of the day was it?</li>
          <li>What was your mood before you had that fantasy?</li>
          <li>
            Had anything happened during that day that led you to be in that
            particular mood?
          </li>
          <li>What was your mood after you had the fantasy?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Now think about other fantasies you have had and answer the same
          questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you see themes developing? Do you tend to have fantasies when you
          are in a particular mood or at a certain time of day? You may find
          that sexual fantasies follow slightly different themes to non-sexual
          fantasies. Make a note of these differences.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Exercise 1B: Fantasy diary</h4>

          Many people who have behaved illegally online feel that as part of
          addressing their behaviour, they have to stop all sexual fantasies.
        </p>
        <p>
          But sexual fantasies themselves are not necessarily a bad thing – it’s
          what happens in that fantasy or who is in that fantasy that might need
          to be addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully you should now be getting a picture of when and why you use
          fantasy.

          Appropriate versus inappropriate fantasy
        </h4>
        <p>
          <img src={pictureOne} alt="digram surley" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Well actually, you&nbsp;are&nbsp;harming yourself because you are
          reinforcing your attraction to things that are illegal and abusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          As explored earlier, we can get pleasure from our fantasies. If the
          subjects of our fantasies are inappropriate, we then associate
          feelings of pleasure with something that is illegal and abusive. This
          is particularly true if you masturbate to the point of ejaculation to
          the fantasy, as the next time you think of the fantasy you will
          remember the pleasure and arousal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is&nbsp;not&nbsp;helpful if you want to control an attraction to
          children or an illegal behaviour such as looking at sexual images of
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what are appropriate and inappropriate fantasies? We split
          inappropriate fantasies into three sections:
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Illegal fantasies</h4>
        <p>
          These are fantasies that would be illegal if they were carried out or
          acted on in real life, such as having sex with a child.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Abusive fantasies</h4>
        <p>
          So, imagine you are a 48 year old man and you are having a sexual
          fantasy about a 16 year old. Is this illegal? No. But is this
          appropriate? We think not, because there is likely to be a difference
          in power, whether that be related to age, money, or life experience.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Not OK for me</h4>
        <p>
          This could be a legal and healthy fantasy for some people, but not for
          you. For example an adult dressed as a school child. This may be ok
          for some people but for those who have a sexual interest in children,
          it may take them a step closer to a fantasy about a child.

        <p>
          Whether a particular fantasy is considered inappropriate can vary from
          person to person; for example it is more appropriate for a 20 year old
          person to have sexual fantasies about a 18 year old, than a 60 year
          old person.
        </p>
        <p>Now let’s see how much you understand fantasy.</p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Exercise 2: Fantasy knowledge</h4>
        <p>
          Read each example of a fantasy below and consider whether you think
          each one is an appropriate or inappropriate fantasy. Then click to see
          what the answer is.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            1. A fantasy about a past sexual partner that you loved and cared
            for.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: This would be an appropriate fantasy and it is ok to have this
          fantasy as it is depicting a scenario which is non-abusive. However,
          if this fantasy is about a sexual relationship you had when you were
          under 16, this would be inappropriate. Also, if you now have a new
          partner you need to consider how healthy this is for you and whether
          it will affect your new sexual relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            2. A fantasy about your employer making you angry, so you slam their
            office door and force them to engage in sexual activity.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: This is an inappropriate fantasy. Forcing someone to do
          something sexual against their will is illegal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            3. A fantasy about an adult engaging in sexual activity with another
            adult wearing school uniform.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: If the fantasy depicts two consenting adults who want to dress
          up in school uniform then this could be an appropriate fantasy.
          However, if you have been accessing indecent images of children, it
          would be inappropriate because you could be reinforcing your
          inappropriate thoughts about children.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            4. A fantasy about sexual activity with a 15 year old who said they
            want to have sex.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: This is an inappropriate fantasy. A child needs to be 16 years
          old to consent to sexual activity and 18 to consent to images of them
          to be shared. Regardless of how old you are, sexual activity with a
          child is illegal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            5. A fantasy about sexual activity with an attractive adult stranger
            you saw walking down the road that day.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer: If you fantasise about meeting each other and consenting to
          this activity, then it would be appropriate.

      <div class="tab-main-content">
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Adult pornography</h4>
        <p>
          The internet has a vast range of adult pornographic material on offer
          and it gives you the chance to explore what you like, what you don’t
          like and the type of person you want to see engaging in sexual
          activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, what you view will start to create and develop your sexual
          preferences and sexual fantasies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fantasies do not automatically lead to behaviours, but they do
          increase your likeliness of wanting to ‘play out’ particular
          fantasies.
        </p>
        <h2>Illegal online sexual behaviour</h2>
        <p>
          Accessing indecent images of children, or sexually communicating about
          or with children, can also shape your sexual fantasies.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you masturbate to these fantasies to the point of ejaculation,
          this positively reinforces the attraction. Masturbation to the point
          of ejaculation is extremely pleasurable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, the things that we think about during masturbation are
          likely to be associated with feelings of arousal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that masturbating to pictures of children or whilst engaged
          in sexual communication with or about a child increases the
          possibility of becoming aroused at the sight or thought of a child.
        </p>
        <h2>Will this make me commit a contact offence?</h2>
        <p>
          We are not saying that everyone who has accessed indecent images of
          children, or who has sexually communicated with or about a child, or
          has masturbated to the thought of a child will go on to commit a
          contact offence.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, if you are masturbating to a fantasy or an image of a child, then
          this is going to develop your sexual preferences, just as adult
          pornography would, but in a very unhealthy and illegal way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although you may not believe this to be an option, under new and
          unknown circumstances, you don’t know how you might act on that
          arousal.
        </p>
        <p>
          People also rehearse things they want to do and build confidence
          through their fantasies. You might not be thinking about enacting your
          fantasies now, but over time, your confidence and urge to act on them
          will increase, especially if you find that you are not getting the
          same level of pleasure from the fantasy; you may find you want to do
          something to increase the buzz.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, using Exercise 3, let’s take a look at one of your inappropriate
          fantasies.
        </p>
        <h2>Exercise 3: Inappropriate fantasy</h2>
        <p>
          Have you recently had a fantasy about a child? If you have, then
          without thinking about it in too much detail, work through these
          questions one at a time and see if these help you think about your
          fantasies differently.
        </p>
        <p>1. Where is this fantasy situated?</p>
        <p>2. What are you doing there?</p>
        <p>3. Who else is there? What are they doing there?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What this fantasy says about you</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4. What role does this fantasy place you in?</p>
        <p>
          5. How does this fantasy compare to the type of person you are
          generally?
        </p>
        <p>
          6. How does this fantasy compare to the type of person you want to be?
        </p>
        <p>7. How does the fantasy of the content compare to real life?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What this fantasy says about how you view others</strong>
        </p>
        <p>8. How do you treat the people in the fantasy?</p>
        <p>9. How do they treat you?</p>
        <p>10. What if the roles were switched?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What this fantasy says about your view of the world</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          11. What sort of world would it be if you or other people were able to
          act on this fantasy?
        </p>
        <p>12. Is this really the type of world you’d like to live in?</p>
        <p>
          13. What is the likelihood of your fantasy ‘expectations’ being met
          and would you want them to be met?
        </p>
        <p>
          14. What would your close friends and family feel about this fantasy?
          What would they think?
        </p>
        <p>
          15. How would you feel if your son or your daughter acted out this
          fantasy with another adult?

          So you have identified which of your sexual fantasies are

        <p>
          For some people this will be easy, but for others it will take time,
          hard work, a lot of willpower and heaps of self-control. You are not
          alone if you feel it is too hard to control these fantasies, but you
          are in control of your thoughts and feelings and you can make a choice
          as to how much attention you choose to give to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many individuals use fantasy management techniques to help stop having
          these harmful sexual fantasies.
        </p>
        <h2>Exercise 4: Use a fantasy management technique</h2>
        <p>
          Have a read through the techniques below. Next time you have a harmful
          sexual fantasy, you need to try and use one of these to help you stop.
          The more you use these, the more you will learn what works more
          effectively for you. It may be that you need to rehearse them or use a
          combination of these to get it just right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Challenging your thoughts</strong>
          <br />
          ‘Why am I having this fantasy; what good is it actually going to do
          me?’ These are examples of questions you can ask and challenge
          yourself with. Be firm with yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could also ask about the consequences to implant fear. ‘Why would
          happen if someone walked in and could see what I was fantasising
          about?’ ‘I know if I keep having this fantasy, I am more likely to
          look at indecent images of children; what are the consequences if I
          was caught?’
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Fantasy replacement</strong>
          <br />
          Change the ending or the subject of your fantasy. For example, if you
          are beginning to indulge in fantasy about a child you have seen in an
          indecent image or communicated with online, change the child to an
          adult. In order to gain the same satisfaction, this will probably not
          be an immediate solution, but you could start by changing small
          features like hairstyle or body form and over time change the whole
          situation. In contrast, try a different fantasy all together which is
          new and exciting…. and legal!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Fantasy blocker</strong>
          <br />
          Imagine someone walking in to your fantasy and catching you. This
          person has to be someone who you would never want to find out, like a
          close friend or family member. Or maybe the police.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Escape route</strong>
          <br />
          Sometimes we need to remove ourselves from the situation in which we
          are fantasising. Get up, get out of that room, leave the house if you
          have to. Go anywhere that stops you from having that sexual fantasy.
          Put yourself around people so that you can’t masturbate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5. Active distraction</strong>
          <br />
          Do something that prevents you from thinking about a fantasy. This
          could be reading, watching TV, going for a walk. It could be ringing a
          friend or going for a drink. Anything that takes your thoughts away
          from that fantasy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6. Urge surfing</strong>
          <br />
          Imagine your fantasy as being like a giant wave. It will build and
          build to a peak and then suddenly go the other way and decline in
          intensity. If you do not masturbate, eventually the urge to do so will
          go away. This happens with all urges, not just sexual urges; for
          example if you are craving chocolate, eventually this craving will go
          away. Urges never stay.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>7. Self-care</strong>
          <br />
          Eating well, exercising, sleeping and relaxation; all of these
          contribute to a happier, healthier you. If you ensure all these are in
          check, you will find managing sexual fantasies much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>8. Praise your success</strong>
          <br />
          The most important thing is to praise yourself for your success. If
          you are able to stop a particular fantasy, congratulate yourself.
          Treat yourself to something nice to eat or do something you enjoy.
          Stopping fantasies can be difficult, especially if you are used to
          having them, so you need to give yourself credit for that.
        </p>
        <h2>What do I do if my sexual preference is children?</h2>
        <p>
          We understand that some people have no sexual interest in adults. They
          often report an exclusive and life-long sexual interest in
          pre-pubescent or pubescent children. If this is true of you, then we
          understand that asking you to replace a child in a fantasy with an
          adult may not work for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than try and change your sexual interest, your task is to learn
          how best to manage your sexual thoughts, feelings and fantasies. Of
          course there are no easy answers but the aim is to try and reduce both
          the frequency of your sexual fantasies and their intensity. We hope
          the suggestions and advice below are helpful:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Try to&nbsp;avoid sexual fantasies about children</strong>
            &nbsp;when masturbating. Of course this can be difficult, especially
            if you are not attracted to adults. To help, try focusing your
            attention exclusively on the physical sensations you experience
            while masturbating. Experiment with different sensations e.g. use of
            lubricants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduce the amount of time</strong>&nbsp;spent thinking or
            fantasising about children in a sexual way. The more time you spend
            having sexual fantasies about children, the more these thoughts will
            govern your mental and sexual life. So, the less time you spend
            thinking about children in a sexual way, the better.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Develop a busy day-to-day lifestyle</strong>&nbsp;with a
            range of activities and interests that hold your attention. The more
            our minds are focused on things that we find engaging and rewarding,
            the less time we spend thinking about sexual things. This helps
            people feel more in control of their sexual thinking. And, of
            course, it helps people feel better about their lives more
            generally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try and&nbsp;<strong>spend time with others</strong>. People tend
            not to day-dream, or have sexual fantasies, when they are
            interacting with others, for example, at work or when socialising.
            Their minds are otherwise occupied.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are aware that you use sexual fantasies as a way of coping
            with other things in your life e.g. an escape from things that are
            worrying you or as a way to relax,&nbsp;
            <strong>find other ways of coping</strong>&nbsp;with these things.
            This will help you reduce the frequency of your sexual fantasies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-care</strong> is important too. If you feel OK about
            yourself, you are less likely to use sexual fantasies as a prop for
            your emotional health. Mindfulness is a technique that has been
            shown to improve people’s mental health and resilience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Don’t beat yourself up</strong>. For many people, it simply
            does not feel realistic to never have sexual fantasies about
            children or to never masturbate. That’s just how it is. Mindfulness
            can help people come to terms with their feelings about this.
            Compassion and self-acceptance is a better mindset than one of
            despair and resignation.
