        <h4 className="secondary-color">Self-Esteem</h4>
        <p>
          Self-esteem is how we value ourselves; it is how we perceive our value
          to the world and how valuable we think we are to other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-esteem affects our trust in others, our relationships, our work –
          nearly every part of our lives. If you have low self-esteem, your
          beliefs about yourself will often be negative. You are likely to focus
          on your weaknesses and on mistakes that you have made, and may find it
          hard to recognise the positive parts of your personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Positive thinking and behaviour can contribute to higher levels of
          self-esteem.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">
          Exercise 1: What can I do to build my self-esteem?
        </h4>
        <p>
          To increase your self-esteem, you need to challenge and change the
          negative beliefs you have about yourself. This might feel like a
          difficult task, but there are a lot of different techniques you can
          try to help you.&nbsp;Below are some of the things that might help and
          some questions to get you started:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Do something you enjoy</strong>
          <br />
          Doing something that you enjoy and are good at, can help build your
          confidence and increase your self-esteem. This could be anything from
          paid work, volunteering, caring for someone or something or a hobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Identify three things you currently do that you enjoy.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Now think of three things you would like to do.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Build positive relationships</strong>
          <br />
          Try to associate with people who will not put you down and whom you
          feel able to talk to about your feelings. If you spend time around
          positive and supportive people, you are more likely to have a better
          self-image and feel more confident.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Name three positive people in your life.&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have low self-esteem, there might be people close to you who
          encourage the negative beliefs and opinions that you have about
          yourself. It is important to identify these people and take action to
          stop them from doing this, perhaps by becoming more assertive (see
          above) or by limiting how much time you spend with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Identify anyone who may be negative in your life.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            List three things you can do to reduce the effect they have on you.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Set yourself a challenge</strong>
          <br />
          If you set yourself goals and work towards achieving them, you will
          feel satisfied and proud of yourself when you achieve your goal, and
          feel more positive about yourself as a consequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it is important to make sure the challenge you set yourself
          is one that you can realistically achieve. It doesn’t have to be
          anything particularly large but should have meaning for you. For
          example, you might decide to start going to a regular exercise class
          or give up smoking.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Think of three challenges:</em>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <em>In the next week</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>In the next month&nbsp;</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>In the next 3 months</em>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <div className="tab-main-content">
        <h4 className="secondary-color">
          It is also important to feel positive and healthy. The following will
          help you achieve this:
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Look after your physical health</strong>
          <br />
          Looking after your physical health can help you feel happier and
          healthier, and improve your self-image.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Physical activity</strong>
          <br />
          Physical activity helps improve people’s sense of wellbeing and image
          of themselves. Exercise releases endorphins – ‘feel-good’ hormones
          that can help improve your mood, particularly if you do it outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sleep</strong>
          <br />
          Lack of sleep can cause negative feelings to be exaggerated and means
          you can feel less confident, so it’s important to make sure you get
          enough sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Diet</strong>
          <br />
          Eating a well-balanced diet at regular meal-times with plenty of water
          and vegetables will help you to feel healthier and happier. Stopping
          or reducing your alcohol intake, and avoiding tobacco and recreational
          drugs can also help improve your general wellbeing.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          As we have identified earlier how you think is very important in how
          you see yourself.
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Learn to identify and challenge negative beliefs</strong>
          <br />
          If you are going to improve your self-esteem, it will help to
          understand more about your negative beliefs about yourself and where
          they came from. (See section on self-talk)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus on positive things</strong>
          <br />
          If you have low self-esteem, it can take practice to get used to
          thinking more positively about yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Exercise 2&nbsp;– How I see myself</strong>
          <br />
          One way you can do this is by making a list of things that you like
          about yourself.
        </p>
        <p>You might include:</p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>things about your personality</li>
          <li>things about the way that you look</li>
          <li>things that you do</li>
          <li>things you are good at- your skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Keep this list and look at a different part of it every day. If you
          are feeling anxious or worried about an event, such as a job
          interview, you can use it to remind yourself of the good things about
          yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you struggle to come up with a list of good things, you could ask
          your partner or a trusted friend to help you begin. This may also help
          you to see how others may have a higher opinion of you than you do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another technique is to write down at least three things that went
          well or that you have achieved that day before you go to sleep. Some
          people also find it helpful to keep objects that make them feel good
          about themselves e.g. cards and letters which they can keep in a ‘feel
          good box.’
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Try mindfulness techniques</strong>
          <br />
          Mindfulness is a way of paying attention to the present moment, using
          techniques like meditation, breathing and yoga. It has been shown to
          help people become more aware of their thoughts and feelings, so that
          instead of being overwhelmed by them, it is easier to manage them.

        <h4 className="secondary-color">Self Esteem and Assertiveness</h4>
        <p>
          People with low self-esteem often struggle to be assertive; this can
          be because they don’t feel they deserve to be listened to. However,
          learning to be assertive and being able to share your views with
          others can help improve your self-esteem. Once you can see other
          people value your views then you can see it yourself.
        </p>
        <h4 className="secondary-color">Learn to be assertive</h4>
        <p>
          Being assertive means being able to stand up for your own or other
          people’s rights in a calm and positive way, without being either
          aggressive or passive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assertive individuals are able to get their point of view across
          without upsetting others, or becoming upset themselves. Someone who is
          assertive states their needs and opinions clearly, so that people take
          notice. Being assertive is a skill which can be developed.&nbsp; It
          requires patience and practice and can result in positive
          communication, better decision making and less of the negative
          feelings which contribute to anger, worry and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be assertive you need to speak up for yourself in a way that does
          not disrespect the other person. It can involve saying no, which can
          be difficult, especially if it is a family member or friend who is
          asking us to do something.
        </p>
        <p>Here is a list of things that might help:</p>
        <ul className="content-list">
          <li>
            Ask the person if you can talk to them on their own- don’t include
            other people
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember that you want to maintain the relationship and that most
            people do not intend to deliberately hurt your feelings
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember if something upsets you, you have the right to speak up
            about it
          </li>
          <li>
            Pay attention to your body language as well as to the words you say
            – try to be open and confident.
            <br />
            Keep your voice calm and low, look the other person in the eye,
            stand up straight so that you look confident (even if you don’t feel
            it)
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to express your feelings if you have been upset – wait until you
            feel calm and explain clearly how you feel.
          </li>
          <li>Stick to the point</li>
          <li>
            Give the other person the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; They may not
            even realise they have upset you or done anything wrong, so what you
            say may come as a surprise
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow people a chance to respond-sometimes people need a chance to
            reflect on things before they can understand your point.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tell people if you need more time or support with tasks that you
            find challenging.
          </li>
          <li>Say ‘no’ to unreasonable requests.</li>

          Look at the list below. Congratulate yourself for&nbsp;all of the
          things that you have done in the last week. For the ones you haven’t

          them in your day to day life.

            Get into the habit of thinking and saying positive things about
            yourself.

        </ul>
        <p>
          Self-praise is an important part of improving your self-esteem, while
          it may feel uncomfortable at first, it gets easier and really helps to
          build towards a better more positive future. Don’t forget to give
          yourself praise every time you achieve one of the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be difficult for people to express their feelings assertively.
          It is important to state how you feel using ‘I’ statements, as no one
          can disagree with how you feel and it doesn’t sound like you are
          blaming the other person. For example if you said to someone ‘you make
          me feel lonely’ versus ‘I feel lonely’. It can be helpful to have a
          structure to how you share difficult feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example:
          <br />
          <strong>DESCRIBE THE SITUATION</strong> – “when we don’t spend time
          together”
          <br />
          <strong>EXPRESS YOUR FEELINGS</strong> – “I feel lonely”
          <br />
          <strong>SPECIFY WHAT YOU WANT TO HAPPEN</strong> – “I would like us to
          have at least one evening a week together”
          <br />
          <strong>STATE THE OUTCOME</strong> – “that way we can have quality
          time together”
        </p>
      </div>
