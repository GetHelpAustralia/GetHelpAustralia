      <p>
        Before using the self-help section, we strongly recommend that you
        complete the explorations in this self-awareness section. This will help
        you better know what problems you may be experiencing.
      </p>

      <p>
        After completing each exploration you will be shown your results along
        with some information to help you interpret them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We recommend that you complete the explorations relating to your
        internet use at the time of offending, and then again once youâ€™ve
        completed the self-help modules. This will give you some feedback about
        what has changed and what problems you may still be experiencing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you have completed the explorations in this section, please move on
        to the modules in the self-help section.
