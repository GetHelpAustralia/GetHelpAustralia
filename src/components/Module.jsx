              <p>
                Self-care means being mindful of our own needs to improve our
                own physical, mental and emotional health. Self-care can take
                many different forms, ranging from making sure we get enough
                sleep to getting some fresh air for a few minutes. Weâ€™ll explain
                some of the different types of self-care and how they can help
                you.

              <h2 className="secondary-color">Why is self-care important?</h2>
              <p>
                Self-care is particularly important when working through the
                information on this website. This work can be difficult,
                especially when feeling other strong emotions like anxiety or
                fear about the future. Making sure we find time for self-care
                can help us deal with the challenges we face in a positive way.
