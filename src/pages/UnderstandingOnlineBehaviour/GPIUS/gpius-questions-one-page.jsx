        <p>
          This tool is designed to allow you to understand your use of the
          internet to further explore how this affects your thoughts and
          behaviour. Rate each question from 1-8 whether you definitely agree or
          disagree. At the end your results will be provided with a brief
          explanation of what your score means. This is a version of the
          Generalised Problematic Internet Use Scale 2 (GPIUS 2. Caplan, 2010).
